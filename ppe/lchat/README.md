# LIQUID CHAT V1.2

Found that PPE by surprise while working on my PCBoard replacement. I had no clue that
I wrote that (but I did - could remember it when I saw it) - was a suprise :).

So I decided to revive it for my upcoming BBS. Unfortunately I lost all original data from that time.
Good that PPE is decompileable.

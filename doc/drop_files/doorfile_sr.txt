[From 93Oct20 SRDOOR.DOC 4.0 documentation]

Note: the SRDOOR.DOC does not mention using 0 on line 6 for local, it's in the SRDOOR.EXE 4.1 though.

    You can also write your own program to convert your favorite door file to DOORFILE.SR. The DOORFILE.SR format is: 

(line 1): Complete name or handle of user
(line 2): ANSI status:  1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = don't know
(line 3): IBM Graphic characters:  1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = unknown
(line 4): Page length of screen, in lines.  Assume 25 if unknown
(line 5): Baud Rate:  300, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200, etc.
(line 6): Com Port:  1, 2, 3, or 4; 0 if local.
(line 7): Time Limit:  (in minutes); -1 if unknown.
(line 8): Real name (the same as line 1 if not known)

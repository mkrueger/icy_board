                                                              PCBoard Commands




Entering Commands
SysOp Commands
User Commands 

When logged into PCBoard, you use commands to accomplish your
tasks online.  When you are reading messages or downloading
files, you are simply executing the appropriate commands to
accomplish these tasks.  Most commands also have subcommands
which is what you use to enter the message number to read, the
file to download, etc.  In other words, these subcommands allow
you to be more specific about what you want to accomplish with
the command that you are executing.

You will enter commands at what is known as the conference
command prompt which usually resembles the following examples:

(39 min. left) Main Board Command?
(112 min. left) Chatter (1) Conference Command?

The first example shows you what the Main Board conference
command prompt (conference 0) would look like.  The second
example shows you what the prompt would look like if you defined
conference 1 to be called Chatter. 

When you enter a command at the conference prompt, PCBoard will
execute it if possible.  If additional information is required,
an additional prompt will be displayed to you.  It is at this
prompt that you would normally enter the subcommands you wish to
use.  If you decided you wish to read messages and entered R at
the conference command prompt, you would see something similar
to the following prompt:

(H)elp, (3262-8623), Message Read Command?

PCBoard knows you want to read messages, but it has no clue as
to what messages you want to read.  By using the appropriate
subcommands for the R user command, you will be able to select
the messages that you wish to read.

One of the major advantages to PCBoard is that you can save time
by stacking commands and subcommands together.  To stack
commands and subcommands together you separate each by a space
or a semicolon.  For example, if you decide that you want to
read the new messages in the current conference you could enter
R;S at the command prompt and bypass the Message Read Command
prompt.  As you become more accustomed to PCBoard and the
various commands that are available, you will find that stacking
gives you the ability to navigate the system as quickly as
possible.

Throughout this chapter, all examples will make use of command
stacking.  This will help you become more familiar with the
concept of stacking and how much time it can save you.


SysOp Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several commands available from the main menu which
are designed to help you, the SysOp, to do many common
maintenance functions.  Using these commands you can do these
following tasks and more:

View, print, search, and delete the callers logs
Pack the current message base
Change a user record
Drop to DOS from remote

The security level for these functions should be set high enough
so that only authorized people will have access to the commands.
 To assign the security levels for these commands, use PCBSetup
and select Security Levels | Sysop Functions.


1  Manage Caller Log

This (Sysop) command enables you to manage the caller log that
PCBoard creates for the current node .  You can view, print,
search, and delete the caller log.

Subcommands

D               Delete caller log.  This subcommand will delete the caller 
                log for the current node.  You may want to use this 
                subcommand to periodically delete the caller log to prevent 
                it from taking up too much disk space.

                WARNING:  Once deleted, PCBoard cannot recover that caller 
                log.

P               Print caller log.  If you use this subcommand, the caller log 
                for the current node will be displayed on the screen and also 
                sent to the printer port that is defined in PCBSetup.

S               Search caller log for text.  The more callers your system has 
                the more difficult it will be to find the information you are 
                looking for in the caller log.  PCBoard provides search 
                capabilities to allow you to search the log file for any 
                text. You can do both a simple one word or one phrase search 
                or you can do complex Boolean searches using the AND, OR, and 
                NOT operators.  For more information on Boolean searching 
                please see Searching For Text in the Sysop's Guide chapter of 
                this manual.

                If PCBoard finds a match when searching the caller log, the 
                log entry for the entire call will then be displayed.  The 
                search text that was found will be highlighted for clarity.

                When PCBoard searches through the callers logs it does not 
                try to match case.  If you tell PCBoard to search for Jim 
                Smith then any caller log that contains the text JIM SMITH 
                would be a match.

V               View caller log.  Using this subcommand you can view the 
                caller log.  The display starts with the most current caller.

Description

The callers log provides you with information about who has
called your system, what node they called in on, highlights of
what they did online, what date and time they called, etc.  When
you view the caller log, PCBoard will display the file to you in
reverse order beginning with the last caller to the system.

You will also want to periodically search the caller log because
that is where any system error messages may be displayed.  In
addition, when a user attempts to access a command that is not
available to them,  that information is almost always written to
the caller log.

The caller log is simply a condensed history of what has taken
place on the BBS.  The 1  command enables you to not only view
the information stored in the caller log but also to print
and/or delete the caller log.

Examples

To view the current node's caller log on your display, type the
following at the command prompt:

1 V

You may want to regularly search your caller log for possible
system errors.  When executed from the command prompt, the
following command will search for any caller log entry that
contains the word FAIL or the word ERROR.

1 S FAIL | ERROR

2   View/Print User List

Enables you to either view or print a list of users.  Each user
is listed on a separate line.

Subcommands

P               Print user listing.  When you use this subcommand, a list of 
                users will be printed to the printer you have defined in 
                PCBSetup.

V               View list of users.  This subcommand will enable you to 
                display a list of your users on the screen.

Description

The list that this command produces lists each user, their city,
last call date, last call time, and total minutes used so far. 
All of this data is listed on one line.  The users are listed in
the order that they appear in the user file.

The only time the SysOp information (user record #1) is
displayed is if the user defined in that record is issuing the
command.  This means that if you use co-SysOps to help you
maintain the system they will not be able to view any
information about the main SysOp user record.

3   Pack/Renumber Messages

This command enables you to pack the message base for the
current conference.  When you pack the message base you can
eliminate messages in the current conference that are old, that
are private and have been read, or those that have been marked
for deletion.  After executing this command, several questions
will be asked to help determine the messages that should be
packed.  The following details each of the questions that will
be asked.

Pack the Message Base?

This question is asked to confirm that you want to pack the
message base.  Valid responses are:

        N       Do not pack the message base.  Instead, return to the 
                conference command prompt.

        Y       Continue packing the message base.  Additional questions will 
                be asked that will determine what criteria you want to use 
                for deleting messages (if any).

Generate ONLY a New Index File?

This question is asking if you want to only regenerate a new
index file for the message base.  Valid responses for this
question are:

        N       If you enter this response, additional questions will be 
                asked to determine the criteria for deleting messages.

        Y       If you enter this response, no other questions will be asked. 
                Instead, PCBPack will be run immediately and create a new 
                index for the conference.  Creating a new index file is 
                useful if you suspect that the current index may be corrupt 
                for some reason.

        TIP:  To accomplish this same task  by executing PCBPACK yourself,  
        use the /INDEX command line parameter.

Purge older than

This question asks you to enter the cutoff date for keeping
messages.  Any messages that are older than the date that you
enter will be deleted from the message base.  In the field
provided, enter the cutoff date for keeping messages.  The
default date in this field is 010180 which will not delete
messages by date.

TIP:  To accomplish this same task  by executing PCBPACK
yourself,  use the /DATE command line parameter.

Purge RECEIVED+PRIVATE Msgs?

Messages that have been assigned RECEIVER ONLY message security
are only useful to the receiver.  Once the message has been read
by this user, you may want to delete it from your message base. 
The question that you are asked will determine if these messages
will be deleted or left in your message base to be packed out by
other criteria.  Valid responses are:

        N       Leave any RECEIVER ONLY messages in the message base.  To be 
                deleted, they will have to meet other packing criteria.

        Y       All RECEIVER ONLY messages that have been read will be 
                deleted from the message base.

        TIP:  To accomplish this same task  by executing PCBPACK yourself,  
        use the /PURGE command line parameter.

Renumber during repack?

This option is designed to allow you to renumber the message
base if you exceed the 16,000,000 maximum message number limit. 
When renumbering your message base, PCBPack does NOT update the
last message read values for your users.  Therefore, if you
renumber the message base without adjusting these values, your
users may not be able to see new messages because their last
message read value remains unchanged.  Using System Manager, you
can reset your user's last message read pointer to 0 to avoid
this problem.  Valid responses to this question are:

        N       Do not renumber the message base -- message numbers will 
                remain unchanged.

        Y       The message base will be renumbered beginning with the number 
                that you specify when prompted.  When the message base is 
                renumbered, the last message read values will not be updated.

        TIP:  To accomplish this same task  by executing PCBPACK yourself,  
        use the /RENUMBER command line parameter.

The Packing Process

Once you have answered all of the questions, PCBoard will load
and run PCBPack.  When PCBPack is finished, control will be
returned to BOARD.BAT.  If you do not load PCBoard using
BOARD.BAT, you will be left at the DOS prompt.

4   Recover a Killed Message

This command enables you to recover a message that has been
deleted or killed.  A message that has been deleted cannot be
recovered if the message base has been packed since the message
was deleted.

Subcommands

[msg #]	Message number to recover.  The only subcommand that is
supported is the message number.  You need to type the message
number that you wish to recover.  If you type in the number of a
message that does not exist  you will be notified that the
message does not exist.

Description

When a message is deleted from the message base via the Kill
command it is only marked for deletion.  You can recover any
message that is marked for deletion and make it active again by
using the 4 command.  Of course, if the message has been
physically deleted by packing the message base the message
cannot be recovered.

5   List Message Headers

This command will list message header information.  The
information pertaining to a message is listed on one line for
easy viewing.

Subcommands

[beg. msg.  #]  Beginning message number.  This is the message number that 
                you wish to begin the scan with.  The default scan direction 
                is in the forward direction.  If you wish to go in the 
                reverse direction please see the - subcommand.

+               Scan in forward direction.  When appended to the beginning 
                message number you can set the direction in which PCBoard 
                scans the message base.  For example if you enter 762+ 
                PCBoard will begin scanning at message number 762 in the 
                forward direction.

-               Scan in reverse direction.  When appended to the beginning 
                message number you can set the direction in which PCBoard 
                scans the message base.  For example if you enter 3569- 
                PCBoard will begin scanning at message number 3569 in the 
                reverse direction.

                NOTE:  PCBoard defaults to searching in the forward direction.

A               Scan selected conferences.  Scans not only the current 
                conference but also those conference which you have set for 
                scanning via the SELECT command or the S conference flag in 
                the users record.

ALL             Scan all conferences.  Scans all conferences you are 
                registered in even if you have not marked the conference for 
                scanning.

F               Message from you.  Only messages that are from you, the user 
                currently online, will be displayed.

L               Begin with last message in message base.  Sets the beginning 
                message number to the last message in the message base.  When 
                you use this subcommand you may omit the beginning message 
                number.

NS              Display in non-stop mode.  The listing of messages will be 
                displayed in non-stop mode.  This means that there will be no 
                more? prompts each time the screen becomes full.

S               Messages that you have not read yet.  Searches only those 
                messages that you have not read yet.

TS              Messages that contain particular text.  This subcommand 
                enables you to search for text in the message body, the TO: 
                field, and the FROM: field.  You can search for a word/phrase 
                or you can use any Boolean search.  For more information on 
                searching for text please see Searching For Text in the 
                SysOp's Guide chapter of this manual.

USER            Messages from a particular user.  You may search the message 
                header for a particular user.  When PCBoard searches for a 
                particular user it will search both the TO: and the FROM: 
                fields in the message header.  You must enter a full 
                user name. Partial matches cannot be made with this command.

Y               Messages addressed to you.  Only messages that are addressed 
                to the user that is currently online will be listed.

Description

The 5 command can be used to quickly search message headers for
information.  This command will produce a list on the screen
that shows such information as who the message is to and from as
well as the subject of the message.

The only difference between the 5 command and the Q command is
that the former will display active messages and also those
messages which have been marked for deletion.

Format of the list

The list that is produced by the format contains the following
information:

Sts.  Displays the status of the message.  An A indicates that
the message is active while an I indicates that the message is
inactive (marked for deletion).

Msg #.  The actual message number in the message base.  Just
before the message number is a status code that shows if the
message has been read, etc.  For a list of status codes please
see the section titled Status Codes.

Ref #.   If the message is a reply, then this field will contain
the message number which was replied to.

To.  Displays who the message is addressed to.  Only the first
15 characters of the user name are displayed.

From.  Displays who the message is from.  Only the first 15
characters of the user name are displayed.

Subject.  Displays the subject of the message.  Only the first
25 characters of the subject are displayed.

Status Codes

Next to each message number is a status code.  You can use these
status codes to determine if the message has been read, if it
has replies, etc.  The following is a list of all valid message
status codes:

	[blank]	A message which can be read by anyone.

        *       A private message to a specific person which has not been 
                read by the person it was addressed to.

        +       A private message which has been read by the person it was 
                addressed to.

        -       A message to a specific person, which was readable by anyone, 
                which has been read by the person it was addressed to.

        ~       A comment to the SysOp which has not been read by the person 
                defined as SysOp record #1.

        `       A comment to the SysOp which has been read by the person 
                defined as SysOp record #1.

        %       A message protected by sender password which has not been read.

        ^       A message protected by sender password which has been read.

        !       A message protected by group password which has not been read.

        #       A message protected by group password which has been read.

        $       A message protected by group password which is addressed to 
                ALL.

Examples

To display the header information for all messages in the
current message base in reverse order you would issue the
following at the command prompt:

5 L

To search for all messages (beginning with the first message in
the message base) either to or from a user named Wally Peterson
you would issue the following at the command prompt:

5 USER WALLY PETERSON 1+

6   View a File

Enables any file to be displayed.  Even if you are calling in
from remote you can view any file.

Subcommands

[filename]      The filename you wish to view online.  This file may be any 
                valid DOS filename.

Description

Sometimes you may want to view a file while you are online. 
This command will display any file in it's raw form making it
primarily useful for viewing ASCII files.  With this command,
you could view batch files, display screens, or any other text
file.

This command is most useful when used from remote because you
can quickly view a file on screen without having to do a remote
drop to DOS.

Example

If you want to display C:\PCB\BOARD.BAT, type following at the
command prompt.

6   C:\PCB\BOARD.BAT

7   User Maintenance

Enables you to modify any user record.  You can adjust security
levels, conference registrations, and more.

Subcommands

[record #]      User record number.  Displays the user record number you 
                type.  If you wish to view record number 10 you would type 
                10.

A               Add a user.  Using this subcommand you may add a user to your 
                users file.  You will be asked to provide the basic 
                information to create the record such as a password, security 
                level, etc. If you attempt to create a record for a user that 
                already exists you will be informed that they already have a 
                record on the system.  If this happens you may want to use 
                the F subcommand to help you locate that record so you can 
                make the appropriate changes.

C               Change current user record.  When you use this subcommand you 
                can make changes to the key fields of the user record (e.g., 
                security level, expiration date, city).  The user record that 
                is currently selected is the one that will be edited.

D               Delete current user record.  Marks the current user record 
                for deletion.  You will first be asked to confirm the 
                deletion. If you proceed to delete the record then the 
                security level will be changed to 0 and the deleted flag will 
                be set to Y.  You can tell if a user record is marked for 
                deletion by looking for a DL: on the display.  If there is a 
                Y next to it then the user has been marked for deletion.  
                Otherwise there should be a N and the user has not been 
                marked for deletion.

                NOTE:  The user will not be physically be removed from the 
                user file until you pack the users file.

F               Find a user.  When you select this subcommand you are asked 
                for the name to search for.  The user file will be searched 
                for the name you supply - partial names will not match.  If 
                the name is found then their user file will be displayed and 
                you can use any other subcommand like C or D to modify the 
                record.

L               List all user records.  Displays the user records beginning 
                with the first user record all of the way to the end.  The 
                format for the output is the same as if you were to select 
                one individual record. 

                NOTE:  Any user records that have a security level higher than
                the current user will not be displayed in the list.

P               Print all user records.  Displays the same information as the 
                L subcommand but sends it to the defined printer instead.

Q               Quit.  Quits the user record editor and returns you to the 
                command prompt.

S               Search user records for text.  This subcommand enables you to 
                search the user records for specific text.  PCBoard will 
                search all ASCII text inside of the user file.  This means 
                fields such as user id, address, phone numbers, password, 
                city, and the two comment fields will be searched.

U               Undelete a user record.  If there is a user record that has 
                been marked for deletion you can use this subcommand to 
                undelete the user.  If you do, you will need to manually 
                change the user security level and expired security level 
                because they were originally changed when the user record was 
                deleted.  You can use System Manager to make the appropriate 
                changes.

NOTE:  Any changes made to a user record (e.g., changes in security level, 
city) while the user is on line will not take affect until the next time the 
user calls in.  For immediate changes to a user record, please refer to the 
SysOp function keys in the PCBoard chapter of this manual.

Description

PCBoard gives you easy access to the user records while you are
online either locally or remote.  You can do such things as
adding users, deleting users, editing user records, etc.  For
security purposes, PCBoard will not allow you to see information
about those users who have a security level higher than your
own.  This enables you to have co-SysOps without enabling them
to see the passwords and other sensitive information about users
with higher security levels.

Format of Record Display

When a user record is displayed on the screen, it is shown in
the following format:

Locating a User to Edit

You can use the S and F subcommands to help you locate the user
you wish to edit.  If you use the F subcommand, you must know
the full user name to search for.  Unless a perfect match is
found then no record will be displayed.  Alternatively you may
use the S subcommand if you wish to search for text or you do
not know the full name.  Any dates you wish to search for must
be in YYMMDD format because that is the way they are stored in
the user file.

Examples

If you wish to search for AMY SEXTON's user record you would
type the following at the command prompt:

7 F AMY SEXTON

If you wish to locate all users who potentially call from
Cassidy, WY then you would type the following at the command
prompt:

7 S CASSIDY, WY

8   Pack User File

The user defined as record #1 in the user file can use this
command to pack the user file while other users are online. 
When you pack the user file, you can eliminate users who have
not called for a while or that have been marked to be deleted. 
After executing this command, several questions will be asked to
help determine the users that should be packed.  The following
details each of the questions that will be asked.

Pack the user file?

This question is asked to confirm that you want to pack the user
file.  Valid responses are:

        N       Do not pack the user file.  Instead, return to the conference 
                command prompt.

        Y       Continue packing the user file.  Additional questions will be 
                asked that will determine what criteria you want to use for 
                deleting users (if any).

Keep 'Locked Out' users?

Locked out users are those that have a security level of 0 but
have not been marked for deletion.  Your response to this
question will determine whether these users will be deleted. 
Valid responses are:

        N       Locked out users will be deleted from the user file.  Since 
                the locked out records will be removed,  the users will no 
                longer be prevented from logging in under the name that was 
                previous locked out.

        Y       Locked out users records will remain in the user file.  This 
                will prevent these users from logging into the system again.

Purge older than

Your response to this question will determine the cutoff date for deleting 
inactive users from the user file.  The default date is 010180 implying that 
no users will be removed for inactivity.  For example, if you want to delete 
all users who have not called since April 1st, 1994, you would enter 040194 
in this field.

Keep whose security =>

Quite often it is desirable to exempt users of a certain security level or 
higher from being packed out of the user file. The default security level is 
100 which prevents anyone of this security level or higher from being deleted 
when the user file is packed.

9   Remote Drop to DOS

Enables you to drop to DOS from remote.  Once in DOS you can run standard DOS 
commands or other DOS applications. 

Subcommands

Y               Yes.  Normally when you select the 9 command and then 
                press ENTER you will be asked to confirm the drop to 
                DOS.  If you wish to bypass this confirmation you may 
                use the Y subcommand.

Description

Inevitably there will be a time when you are calling into your system from 
remote and realize that you need to drop to DOS and do a little maintenance.  
When you incur a situation like this, you realize just how handy the 9 
command is to have around. With this command you can drop to DOS and run 
other programs. PCBoard allows maximum flexibility by running a batch file 
called REMOTE.SYS to drop you to DOS.

Setting Up REMOTE.SYS

For the most reliable remote DOS access, you need to use a third-party 
program.  This program should be able to redirect your screen displays.  At 
the very least, it should be able to handle all text mode applications.

DOORWAY is a program written by Tri-Mark Engineering that will handle just 
about any 80x25 text mode program.  It will redirect the text mode screen to 
the remote user using the popular ANSI escape codes.  A sample REMOTE.SYS 
using DOORWAY might look like this:

set box=no
doorway com1 /s:.\ /v:d^O /o: /k:v0 /c:dos
set box=
c:
cd \pcb
board

Two things should be noted about the above example.  If you are using a 
serial port other than COM1 then you will have to make the appropriate change 
to reference the port you are using.  In addition, the last two lines of this 
example return you back to your PCBoard subdirectory and then execute 
BOARD.BAT to reload PCBoard.  It is essential that you return back to your 
PCBoard subdirectory before you execute BOARD.BAT.  Verify that you change to 
the appropriate drive and subdirectory.

Using Function And Alt Keys

When you drop to DOS, you may load one of your maintenance programs such as 
PCBFiler or PCBSetup.  Most likely your communications program will intercept 
all of the cursor movement and function keys.  Check your communications 
program to see if it supports what most call DOORWAY mode.  This mode in 
communications programs will allow them to pass the cursor key movements and 
function keys to the remote system.

10   Execute DOS Command

This command enables you to execute DOS commands directly from the PCBoard 
command prompt.

Description

When this command is executed you are asked for the command you would like to 
execute.  Once you type in the command, PCBoard will shell to DOS and execute 
the command you issue.  

How much memory is available when shelled out?

The amount of memory that will be available depends on your answer to Swap 
Out During Shell in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Switches.  A Y means 
that you will have slightly less memory available to you than you had when 
you loaded BOARD.BAT. An answer of N means that you will have slightly less 
then the free memory shown on the status line.

Please keep in mind your memory restrictions because if you run an 
application and there is not enough memory available, you will return back to 
PCBoard without the command executing.

What programs can be run?

When you are on locally, you can run any application assuming you do not run 
into any memory restrictions.  When you are executing this command from 
remote, however, there are some items you must take into consideration.

If the command you execute from remote requires any interaction or input from 
the keyboard, you will not be able to execute these programs using the 10 
command.  The reason you cannot use these programs is that you are logged in 
remotely and have no control over the BBS's keyboard.  If you attempt to run 
one of these programs, that node on your system will appear to hang.

What really happened is PCBoard executed the program and then ran into a 
situation that required keyboard input.  PCBoard waits until the program is 
finished before returning which means the node will be stuck until it can be 
fixed.  If you need to run an application that requires user interaction or 
input from the keyboard you should use the 9 command instead.

11   View Users Currently Online

Enables you to view a list of all of the active nodes, who is online, and 
what they are currently doing on the BBS.

Description

On multinode systems this command displays the name and location of users 
that are currently online on all of the nodes in the system.  This display 
also shows what the user is currently doing on the system.

Status Messages

The display of all active nodes has a Status column.  This column displays a 
brief description of what the user is currently doing online.  A list of 
status messages follows:

Auto Logoff Pending 	No Caller this Node 
Available for CHAT 	Out of Code in DOOR 
CHAT Request Sent 	Paging the Sysop 
CHATTING with Group 	Run/Answer Script 
DOS Recycle Pending 	Running Event 
Dropt to DOS Pending 	Transferring a File 
Drop to DOS - Urgent 	Unavailable for CHAT 
Logging into System 	

As you can see, you can obtain a significant amount of detail
about what each user is doing online from executing the 11
command.

Additional Information

Since the 11 command is a SysOp command, you will also have
additional information available to you.  The following shows
the status messages that will show additional information when
you use this command:

Transferring a File

When a user is transferring a file, PCBoard will display as much information 
as it can.  Internal protocols, by their very nature, update after each file.  
If PCBoard knows enough about the file transfer, it will display if a 
transfer is an (U)pload or a (D)ownload, the filename that is being 
transferred, the protocol letter used, the size of the file being 
transferred, and finally the estimated time of transfer.  The line underneath 
the user's name may resemble the following:

(D) PCBMULT.ZIP (G) 44,573  -  0.6

This tells you that the user is downloading a file called PCBMULT.ZIP using 
protocol letter G and that the file is 44,573 bytes which will take 
approximately .6 minutes or about 36 seconds to transfer.

(U) TESTSLC.ZIP (G) 141,042  -  1.6

This entry shows that the user is uploading a file called TESTSLC.ZIP using 
protocol letter G.  The size of the file is 141,042 bytes and will take about 
1.6 minutes or 1 minute 36 seconds to upload.

(U) ... (Z) ...

This simply shows that the user is uploading using the protocol defined by 
the letter Z, but the filename and transfer information could not be 
determined because the protocol is external.

PCBoard updates this information at various times.  The following details 
when internal and external protocols update the information for this display:

Internal Protocols

Internal protocols, by their very nature, know how to update PCBoard.  As 
each file is transferred, the display will be updated to show the current 
status.  The only exception is if a user is using an internal non-batch 
protocol to upload a file. In this case, you will only see that the user is 
uploading a file and what protocol they are using.

External protocols

External protocols do not update nearly as often simply because they do not 
know what to update since most are not PCBoard specific.  PCBoard does its 
best on downloads by showing the last file that will be transferred.  On 
uploads, you will simply see that someone is uploading a file and what 
protocol they are using.  You will not know what file they are uploading.

NOTE:  If a user is viewing the contents of a file, PCBoard will show the 
name of the file they are viewing below their user name.  The format that the 
filename is displayed in is the following:

F V FILENAME.EXT

Entering a Message

When a user is entering a message, you will be shown what
conference they are in, followed by who the message is being
addressed to.  For example, if the user was in conference 9 and
entering a message to JOHN SMITH then you would see the
following under the user's name:

(9) => JOHN SMITH

Run/Answer Script

If a user is completing a script, you will see the conference
and the script number they are completing listed underneath
their name.  For example, if a user was in conference #1 and
filling out script #2, you would see the following under the
user's name:

(1) => #2

If you have a script questionnaire which is a PPE file, the
filename of the PPE will be displayed.  For example:

C:\PCB\GEN\SCRIPT2.PPE

Running Event

When an event is running on a node, PCBoard will update the
display of the nodes to show the event number and event name
that is currently running.  The format for the display is:

#1 -> DAILY

This example shows the display if event #1 is executing and the
event BATCH file is called DAILY.

Example

If you execute the 11 command you might see a display which
looked like this:

(#)   Status                  User
---   ---------------------   -----------------------------
  1   Transferring a File     STEWART OGDEN (HIGHLAND, KS)
                              (D) PCBMULT.ZIP (G) 44,573  -  0.6
  2   Run/Answer Script       FRED KORKLEWSKI (ALBURY HEIGHTS, NV)
                              (1) => #2
  3   Entering a Message      BILLY CRUMP (GREENMEADOW, NV)
                              (9) => JOHN SMITH
  4   No Caller this Node
  5   No Caller this Node
  6   No Caller this Node
  7   Transferring a File     WINIFRED NEIDERHAUSER (SAN SIMEON, NE)
                              (U) ... (Z) ...
 10   No Caller this Node
 11   No Caller this Node
 12   Logoff Alternate Node

Enables you to immediately logoff a user that is currently online.

Subcommands

[node #]        Node number.  The node number you wish to logoff.  The user 
                is displayed a message which informs them that an automatic 
                logoff has been initiated.

Description

Sometimes you may need or want to logoff a user that is currently on another 
node.  PCBoard provides a SysOp command that enables you to do this.  When 
you issue this command you must supply the node number that you wish to log 
off.  Once you type in a valid node number the user will be logged off of the 
system

NOTE:  If the user is currently in a third party application, such as a door, 
they will not be logged out of the system until they return back to PCBoard.  
Likewise, the user will be allowed to finished any file transfers before they 
are logged off of the system.

13   View Node Caller Log

Enables you to view other node's caller logs from any other node.  You may 
search or view any or all node's caller logs.

Subcommands

[node #]        Node number.  The node number you wish to view or A to view 
                all nodes.  If you enter a node number that does not have a 
                caller log then an error message will be written to the 
                caller log notifying you that the caller log for the node 
                specified does not exist.  In addition, entering a number 
                which exceeds the number of nodes in your software license 
                will re-display a list of who is currently online so that you 
                can pick a valid node.



A               All caller logs.  Specifies that all node log files should be 
                used not just an individual node.  This subcommand is most 
                useful when used in a search using the S subcommand.

S               Search for text.  The more callers your system has the more 
                difficult it will be to find the information you are looking 
                for in the various caller logs.  PCBoard provides 
                capabilities for you to search the log file for any text.  
                You can do a simple one word, one phrase, or a complex 
                Boolean search using the AND, OR and NOT operators.  For more 
                information on Boolean searching please see Searching For 
                Text in the Sysop's Guide chapter of this manual. 

If PCBoard finds a match when searching the caller log, the log entry for the 
entire call will then be displayed.  The search text that was found will be 
highlighted for clarity.

When PCBoard searches through the caller logs it does not try to match case.  
If you tell PCBoard to search for Jim Smith then any caller log that contains 
the text JIM SMITH would be a match.

Description

The caller logs provide you with information about who has
called your system, what node they called in on, highlights of
what they did online, what date and time they called, etc.  When
you view the caller log PCBoard will display the file to you in
reverse order beginning with the last caller to the system.

You will want to periodically search the caller log because that
is where any system error messages are recorded.  In addition,
when a user attempts to access a command that is not available
to them,  that information is written to the caller log.

Examples

To view node 5's caller log you would type the following at the
command prompt:

13 5

You may want to regularly search all of your caller logs for
possible system errors.  When executed from the command prompt,
the following command will search for any caller log entry on
any node that contains the word FAIL or the word ERROR.

13 A S FAIL | ERROR

14   Drop Node to DOS

Enables you to drop another node to the DOS prompt from any
other node.

Subcommands

[Node #]	Node number.  The node number you wish to drop to DOS.

Description

This command will drop any active node to a DOS prompt.  You are asked if you 
wish to have the node drop to DOS after the caller logs off, or if you wish 
to immediately drop that node to DOS.

In order to drop to DOS immediately, PCBoard must be in control. If the user 
is shelled out to an external protocol or running a door, the node will not 
be dropped to DOS until PCBoard regains control.

15   Recycle Node

This command will mark the node number that you specify to be
recycled.  When recycling the node, you can execute a batch file
to perform any necessary processes (e.g., updating files) in
BOARD.BAT.

Subcommand

[node]          Node number to recycle.  This value represents the node 
                number that will be recycled.

Description

When a node is recycled, PCBoard exits with an errorlevel of 6
and then continues executing BOARD.BAT.  You can use this
recycle to run a batch file that would update necessary system
files or whatever is needed.  Simply add a line to  BOARD.BAT
that checks for an errorlevel of 6.  If an errorlevel of 6 is
detected, run the appropriate batch file.  The following might
resemble your new BOARD.BAT file:

@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set pcb=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb
pcboard
if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist endpcb goto end
if errorlevel == 6 call c:\update.bat
board
:end

In this example, C:\UPDATE.BAT would be executed if the node is marked for 
recycling.  Because the call statement is used, DOS will return control back 
to BOARD.BAT which will execute the next line which consequently reloads 
PCBoard.  The system is ready for callers again and the batch file updated 
any necessary files.

NOTE:  A node can also be marked for recycling by pressing ALT-R
while a user is online.

BR   Broadcast Message to Any Node

Enables you to send a brief message to any node number.  You can
use this command to notify users that you are about to shut down
the system or just to say hello.

Subcommands

[node #]        Node number.  This can be any active node number.  You may 
                also type ALL in place of the node number to broadcast the 
                message to all active nodes.

[message]       Message to send to another node.  Any text up to 48 
                characters in length.  Text is displayed in all capital 
                letters and punctuation is omitted.

Description

Allows any user with SysOp security to display a message to any or all active 
nodes.  This command is useful to notify users that the system may be going 
down, or if you wish to have all users log off of the system.

When the message is displayed to the user it will also send a beep to help 
get the user's attention.

NOTE:  All subcommands must be placed on the command line.  If you type BR 
and press enter then you will be returned back to the command prompt and no 
action will have taken place.

If a user is not in PCBoard (e.g., the user is currently in a DOOR) then the 
user will not see the message because they were not in PCBoard at the time 
the broadcast message was sent.

Examples

To broadcast a message to node 1 which says PLEASE LOG OFF AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE you would type:

BR 1 PLEASE LOG OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

To broadcast a message to all active nodes which notifies the
users that you would like them to log off of the system you
would type the following at the command prompt:

BR ALL PLEASE LOG OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

User Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While you are logged into the bulletin board system,  you can issue several 
commands. These commands allow you to read mail, transfer files, read 
bulletins, and much more.  Each command can be assigned a minimum security 
level which is required to execute a particular command.  For more 
information on assigning security levels to user commands please see the 
Security Levels section in the PCBSetup chapter of this manual.

!   Re-Display Last Command

This command will re-display the last command that you entered that was at 
least five characters in length.

Description

Sometimes you may want to re-display the last command that you entered so 
that you can execute it again.  From the Conference Command prompt, you can 
use this command to re-display the last command that you executed that was at 
least five characters in length.  In the long run, this could save you a lot 
of typing. This command is almost identical to pressing 3 while at a DOS 
prompt.

A   Abandon Conference

Abandons the current conference and returns back to the Main Board conference 
(a.k.a. Conference #0).

Description

On some bulletin board systems, the majority of activity takes place in the 
Main Board (otherwise known as conference #0).  A conference enables you to 
go to another area of the bulletin board which may focus on a particular 
topic or subject.

The Abandon conference command enables you to quickly exit a conference you 
have joined and to return back to the Main Board. Alternatively, you may 
return to the Main Board by issuing either of the following commands:

J 0

J MAIN

ALIAS   Alias Name Usage

This command allows you to turn your alias on or off when in a
conference which allows aliases to be used.

Subcommands

ON              Use your alias.  Your alias will be active.

OFF             Use your real name.  Even though you are in a conference 
                where aliases are allowed, your real name will be used.

Description

When you are in a conference that allows aliases, this command enables you to 
decide when your alias will be active.  When you enter this command with no 
subcommands, the status of using your alias will toggle.  If your alias is 
active and you execute this command with no subcommands, you will switch to 
using your real name.  When you switch, PCBoard will attempt to hide the 
change by making it appear that someone is logging into the node.

This command will have no effect if you attempt to use it in a conference 
where aliases are not allowed, or if the Alias PSA is not installed.

Examples

This example will show you what to enter if you want to toggle the status of 
your alias from either on to off or from off to on:

ALIAS

To turn usage of your alias on, enter:

ALIAS ON

B   Bulletins

Bulletins could display information like rules for the bulletin
board system, how to gain additional access, or additional
information.

Subcommands

[bulletin #]    Bulletin number.  This is the bulletin number you wish to 
                view.  You may list several bulletin numbers separated by a 
                SPACE or a ;.  

A               All bulletins.  If you wish to view all bulletins instead of 
                manually entering the numbers, use this subcommand.  Using 
                this subcommand will cause PCBoard to either view all 
                bulletins, or if you are using the S subcommand, all 
                bulletins will be searched.

D               Download bulletins.  Allows you to download a bulletin rather 
                than viewing it online.

N               New bulletins.  Display only new/updated bulletins since the 
                last time you called.  At login, you will automatically be 
                notified of which bulletin numbers are new or have been 
                updated.

NS              Display in non-stop mode.  When a bulletin is displayed, this 
                subcommand will make it so that there are no more? prompts 
                displayed.  This might be useful when manually capturing to a 
                file.  If you do not use the NS subcommand, you may also type 
                NS at any more? prompt.

R               Re-display menu.  Will cause the main bulletin menu to 
                display again.  This subcommand is most useful when issued 
                immediately after you have viewed a bulletin.  That way you 
                can see the menu again and select another bulletin to view.

S               Search bulletins for text.  This subcommand allows you to 
                search a bulletin for text.  Any time the search text is 
                found it will be highlighted on the display.  You may do a 
                simple one word or one phrase search, or a complex Boolean 
                search using the AND, OR, and NOT operators.  For more 
                information on text searching please see Searching For Text 
                in the SysOp's Guide chapter of this manual. 

Description

A bulletin is basically a text file that may be viewed online. A bulletin 
usually contains important information for the callers.  It may also be used 
to list sales reports, or just about any other text file you wish to display 
online.

PCBoard enhances bulletins by allowing you to download and
search the bulletins.  Using the subcommands described above,
you can control not only which bulletins you view but also what
parts of the bulletins you actually view.

Examples

To download bulletins 1, 8, and 15 on the system, enter the
following at the conference command prompt:

B 1 8 15 D

To view bulletins 6, 12, 15, and 30, enter the following at the
conference command prompt:

B 6 12 15 30

Searching bulletins can be a real time saver.  To search all of
the bulletins in the current conference for the word
subscription, enter the following at the conference command
prompt:

B A S subscription

When logging into the system, you will be notified if any
bulletins have been updated.  These bulletins can be viewed by
using the N subcommand.  At the conference command prompt, enter:

B A N

CHAT   Group Chat

This command allows you to chat interactively with one or more
users that are currently on the bulletin board system.

Subcommands

A               Available for chat.  By default, you are available for chat 
                when you log into the bulletin board system.  If you have 
                made yourself unavailable for chat, you may make yourself 
                available for chat again by using this subcommand.  When you 
                logoff, your chat status will be used on your next call as 
                well.

G               Enter group chat.  Use this subcommand to begin chatting with 
                other users on the system.

U               Unavailable for chat.  When you use this subcommand, you make 
                yourself unavailable for chat.  This means that other callers 
                will not be able to call you into group chat.  When you 
                logoff, your chat status will be used on your next call as 
                well.

Description

Node chat allows 2 or more people to communicate with each other across 
separate nodes of the BBS.  When you are in chat, you may select any of the 
available 255 channels to chat with other users.  If another user is 
available for chat you may request that they chat with you.

Entering Chat Mode

When you execute the CHAT command and then select G for group chat you will 
be put into group chat mode.  PCBoard begins by asking you the channel you 
would like to use for chatting.  If you compare this to a CB, you can pick 
any of 255 channels to chat on.  Each channel could be talking about 
different subjects.  To get a list of the currently active channels, you can 
press L at this prompt.

Next, depending on the system configuration, you are asked is the handle you 
would like to go by while you are in chat.  This will default to your first 
name, but you can change this to any name you wish.  When text is displayed 
by you, it will have a banner showing what node number you are and your 
handle.

NOTE:  If you were notified that someone wanted to chat with you, then the 
default channel number will be the channel that the other user called you 
from.

After you select a channel to chat on, you will be in chat mode. If you need 
help with the commands available in chat, press H at the Chat Command prompt. 
If you press R, you will enter into Chat Mode with the other callers on the 
system.  Pressing ESC will bring back the Chat Command prompt.

Chatting With Other Users

Once you are in a channel you may begin typing.  Anyone else in that channel 
will see what you type as you type it.  However, only one person has the 
focus.  The focus is used so that only one person can be typing while others, 
if they do type, do not interrupt.  However, you may type up to one line 
ahead when you do not have the focus.  Once you have the focus, any text that 
you have typed will be sent out and you can continue to type because you have 
the focus.

The only way you can lose the focus once you have it is by being inactive.  
If you are on the first character of a line, after two seconds of not typing, 
you will give up the focus to someone else in the channel so that they may 
type.  Anywhere else on the screen (such as the middle of the screen) you can 
be inactive for 10 seconds before the focus will be given to someone else.

While you are chatting, you can press ESC to access the chat mode commands.  
These additional chat mode commands allow you to call other users into chat, 
make discussions private, etc.  The following section details these commands.

Commands Available While In Chat

CALL            Call a user to chat.  This command lets you invite other 
                users into your chat session.  These users may already be in 
                group chat, or they may be out in the main part of the BBS.  
                As long as the user has not made himself unavailable and is 
                not busy performing other tasks, you may issue a CALL command 
                to request the caller to chat.  It should be understood that 
                the caller may ignore your offer to chat if they so wish.



CHAN            Change channels.  A Channel is a separate group of people or 
                topic of conversation.  There are 255 channels available. Use 
                the SHOW command to see what conversations, by topic, are 
                currently taking place and who is involved in each.  The 
                MONITOR command will let you listen in on all non-private 
                channels to help you decide which conversations you might 
                wish to join.

ECHO            Enable echo mode.  By default, echo mode is turned on.  If 
                you used the NOECHO command, then you may turn on echo mode 
                again, by using this command.

G		Goodbye.  See the G user command.

HANDLE          Change your handle.  A handle simply allows you to identify 
                yourself without requiring that your entire name be used.  A 
                handle does not hide your identity (as seen by a WHO command 
                in PCBoard) but merely provides you the ability to be known 
                by another name while in chat.

IGNORE          Ignore input from one or more nodes.  The IGNORE command 
                allows you to ignore the input coming from one or more nodes. 
                If a caller in your channel is becoming a nuisance, that 
                caller can be ignored.  However, ultimately the better 
                solution would be to switch to another channel and make it 
                private.

MENU            Display menu for chat commands.  You may display the menu of 
                chat commands at any time by using this command.  It works 
                even if you are in expert mode.

MON             Toggle the monitoring of public channels.  This command will 
                allow you to toggle monitoring of public channels.  If you 
                turn monitor mode on then you will be seeing all chat that is 
                occurring in all public channels.  If you do not want to 
                monitor all public channels, enter the channels that you do 
                want to monitor when prompted.

NOECHO          Disable echo mode.  The NOECHO command allows you to disable 
                the input echoing that normally occurs.  With echoing 
                enabled, your system must be capable of handling ANSI cursor 
                position commands and even then you are limited to ONE line 
                of text that can be typed ahead while another caller is 
                typing. With echoing disabled, ANSI is no longer required and 
                since a local split screen is used, none of the text is 
                transmitted until you press enter so you may type more than a 
                single line of text while others are typing.  Use the ECHO 
                command to re-enable echoing.
          
PRIV            Make discussion private.  A Private Discussion prevents 
                others not already in the channel from monitoring or joining. 
                Use this command to make the channel that you are in private. 
                If you want to make the current channel public, you would use 
                the PUBLIC command.  Channel #1 can never be made private 
                which leaves it open for newcomers to the chat.

                NOTE:  The CALL command is the ONLY way that someone outside 
                of a Private Discussion can join.  Once you CALL the user, 
                they may join the private discussion.

PUBlic          Make discussion public.  An Open Discussion is one in which 
                others may freely join.  During the course of an open 
                discussion you may notice other callers joining in.  An 
                announcement of each arrival or departure is made to let you 
                know who is in chat.  The SILENT command can be used to turn 
                these announcements off.

Q               Exit chat mode.  Exits you out of chat mode back to the main 
                part of the bulletin board system.

SEND            Send a private message.  This command can be used to 
                privately send a one line message to another caller that is 
                already in group chat.  You are asked for the node number 
                that you want to send the message to.  The caller that you 
                send the private message to needs to be in chat mode but does 
                not have to be in the same channel as yourself.

SHOW            Show users currently chatting.  This command will show you 
                all active channels, what users are in each channel, and what 
                the topic of discussion is.

SILENT          Toggle silent mode.  If you wish to ignore the system 
                messages which tell you which users have joined or left the 
                channel, you would toggle silent mode on using this command.  
                By default, silent mode is off.

TOPIC           Change current topic.  Each channel can have a topic or 
                title.  You can change the topic of the current channel by 
                using this command.

WHO             Show who is currently on-line.  See the W user command.

X		Toggle expert mode.  See the X user command.

Sysop Commands Available While In Chat

A few of the SysOp commands that are available while in the main
part of the bulletin board system are also available to SysOps
while they are in chat mode.  You can enter the following SysOp
commands while in chat mode:

	7	View/edit user records.  
	11	View status of nodes.  
	12	Logoff alternate node.  
	13	View alternate node's caller log.  
	14	Drop alternate node to DOS.  

For more detailed information on these commands, see the detailed 
descriptions in the SysOp commands portion of this manual.

C   Comment To The Sysop

Enables you to leave a message to the SysOp.  The message is addressed to 
SysOp and is always a private message.

Description

When you have a question about the system, you will want to leave a message 
to the SysOp.  PCBoard provides a command to enter a message to the SysOp 
without worrying who the message should be addressed to.  Before the messages 
is entered, you will be asked to confirm that you wish to leave a comment to 
the SysOp.  If you answer with a Y, you will be taken directly into the 
message editor.

When you save the message it will be placed into the current conference 
unless you have answered Y to the Force COMMENTS-to-the-Sysop into Main field 
in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Messages.

D   Download A File

Allows you to download or transfer a file from the bulletin board system to 
your computer system.

Subcommands

[filename]      The filename that will be transferred.  For batch transfers, 
                multiple filenames may be entered on the same line if 
                separated by a SPACE or a ;.  In addition, when selecting 
                files to transfer the DOS wildcard characters (* and ?) can 
                be used to select groups of files.  If you do not type in the 
                filename extension, PCBoard will search the files online to 
                see if there is a match.  See the examples that follow for 
                more details.

[protocol]      In order to transfer a file, you must use a file transfer 
                protocol.  You may set any protocol as the default protocol.  
                If you wish to temporarily use another protocol for a 
                particular transfer, pass the temporary protocol letter with 
                the D command.  To obtain a list of protocol letters, use the 
                T user command.



NOTE:  The protocol letter may also be entered when PCBoard asks
for the filename to download.  The only protocol that cannot be
selected in this manner is the H protocol, as it would display
online help instead.  The preferred method is to pass the
protocol letter with the D command.

BYE     This subcommand will cause you to be logged off of the bulletin 
        board once the file transfer is complete.  You are given 10 
        seconds to abort the automatic logoff.

GB      This subcommand will cause you to be logged off of the bulletin 
        board once the file transfer is complete.  You are given 10 
        seconds to abort the automatic logoff.

Description

One of the most popular activities on a bulletin board is the 
transferring of files.  Downloading refers to you  receiving a file from 
the bulletin board system.  In order to transfer a file, you must select 
a protocol to transfer via the Transfer protocol command.  If you select 
N (for no default) protocol, PCBoard will prompt for the protocol to use 
on each file transfer.

Once the files have been selected for download, PCBoard will be ready to 
begin the transfer.  When PCBoard notifies you that the file transfer is 
ready to begin, use your communications software to begin the download.  
Normally this is done by pressing d on the remote keyboard and selecting 
the same protocol as the bulletin board is using.

Examples

To download a file called TEXTEDIT.ZIP, the user could issue the
following:

D TEXTEDIT.ZIP

To download NEWUTIL.ZIP and ISD320.ZIP using the G protocol
letter, you would enter:

D NEWUTIL.ZIP ISD320.ZIP G

To download NEWUTIL.ZIP and immediately disconnect once the file
transfer is complete, enter:

D NEWUTIL.ZIP BYE

DB   Download Batch

Like the Download command, this command allows you to transfer files 
from the bulletin board system to your machine.  This command however, 
assumes that the file transfer will consist of multiple files (otherwise 
known as a batch transfer).

Subcommands 

[filenames]     You may enter multiple filenames on the same line or you 
                may enter a single filename to download on each line.  
                The list of files to download will be considered 
                complete when  ENTER is pressed at a Enter the filename to 
                Download (Enter)=none? prompt.

[protocol]      In order to transfer a file, you must use a file 
                transfer protocol.  You may set any protocol as the 
                default protocol.  If you wish to temporarily use 
                another protocol for a particular transfer, pass the 
                protocol letter with the D command.  To obtain a list of 
                protocol letters, use the T user command.

                NOTE:  The protocol letter may also be entered when 
                PCBoard asks for the filename to download.  The only 
                protocol that cannot be selected in this manner is the H 
                protocol, as it would display online help instead.  The 
                preferred method is to pass the protocol letter with the 
                D command.

BYE             This subcommand will cause you to be logged off of the 
                bulletin board once the file transfer is complete.  You 
                are given 10 seconds to abort the automatic logoff.

GB              This subcommand will cause you to be logged off of the 
                bulletin board once the file transfer is complete.  You 
                are given 10 seconds to abort the automatic logoff.

Once all of the filenames have been entered, you have the option to edit 
the batch of files to send.  If you decide to edit the the batch, you 
will be able to add, remove, and list the batch list.

Editing The List of Files to Download

Once you have entered the filenames to be downloaded, a screen will be 
displayed which shows how many files are in the batch, how many total 
bytes in the batch, and which protocol has been selected.  At this 
point, you may edit the batch transfer, abort the transfer, or to begin 
the transfer by pressing R.

If the batch transfer is aborted, the files will remain flagged. This 
enables you to do something else on the system and then return and 
download the files again without having to type in the filenames again. 
When executing the D or DB commands while files are flagged for 
download, you will be asked if you want to download the flagged files. 
If you answer N to that question, the files will be un-flagged.

If you decide to edit the batch, you will be able to add files to the 
batch, remove files from the batch, and to also list all files currently 
in the batch.  The following options are available  to edit the batch 
list:

        A       Add a file to the batch.  Enables you to add one or more 
                files to the batch.  To stop adding files to the batch, 
                press Rat an Enter filename to Download prompt.

        R       Remove a file from the batch.  Enables you to remove a 
                filename from the batch.  To remove a file, you must 
                enter the number to remove from the batch.  To get the 
                number in the batch, list the batch.

        L       List files in the batch.  Lists all filenames that are 
                currently in the batch and their corresponding number in 
                the batch.  If you have flagged TCRN10.ZIP and 
                LSTR312.ZIP,  listing their batch would look like the 
                following:

File Selected:  (1)   TCRN10.ZIP     32,612 bytes,  0.5 minutes (approximate)
File Selected:  (2)   LSTR312.ZIP   532,981 bytes, 40.1 minutes (approximate)

        P       Protocol letter.  To use a protocol that is different 
                than your default protocol for this transfer, enter this 
                letter at the prompt.  You will be shown a list of 
                protocols that are available.  Choose the protocol that 
                you want to use from this list.

Once you have finished editing the batch (if you chose to) you are ready to 
begin the transfer.  At this point, use your communications program to begin 
a download.  In most  programs this can be accomplished by pressing d 
followed by selecting a protocol and typing in the filename or directory to 
download files to.  Of course this varies from communications program to 
communications program so if you have difficulties in this area, consult your 
documentation.

E   Enter a Message

Electronic communications is becoming more and more popular. The most 
popular method to communicate with other users on a bulletin board 
system is to enter messages or electronic mail.

Subcommand

[user name]     The user name or user id that the message will be 
                addressed to.  When PCBoard prompts for a user, this 
                value will be the default addressee.

Addressing a Message

To enter a message you must address the message to a person or a group of 
people.  PCBoard will ask you who the message should be addressed to. At the 
TO: prompt type in a valid user name.  In conferences that are not set to echo 
mail, PCBoard will check the message base to make sure that the user actually 
exists.

As the SysOp, you may also address the message to the following:

@[sec]@         If you want a message to be seen only by a particular 
                security level, then you would address the message to @ 
                followed by the security level then another @ sign.  As a 
                user with the security level specified reads this message, it 
                will appear to be addressed to them.

@[sec]-[sec]@   Sometimes you may wish to address a message to a range of 
                security levels.  If you would like to do this, you can do so 
                by addressing the message to @ followed by the low security 
                level, a dash, the high security level, and finally another @ 
                sign.  For example, if you wanted to address a message to 
                security levels 10-40, you would address the message to 
                @10-40@.  When a user between the security of 10 and 40 sees 
                the message, it will appear to be addressed to them.  Sysops 
                will see it addressed to (Generic Message).

@USER@          To make a message that is personally addressed to everyone on 
                the system, you can address the message to @USER@. This 
                allows you to enter just one message but make it appear that 
                it is addressed to each person individually.  When SysOps 
                view the message it will be addressed to (Generic Message).

@LIST@          Sometimes you want to address a message to a select group of 
                individuals but they may not have something like a security 
                level in common.  If you address a message to @LIST@, you 
                will be prompted for names that you would like to address the 
                message to.  The actual limit for the numbers that can be 
                entered is in PCBSetup | Conferences (2nd configuration 
                screen of the conference).  After entering your message, you 
                will notice that the list of names that you addressed the 
                message to is stored at the bottom of the message.  This list 
                keeps track of whether each user has read the message or not 
                and if so, when they read the message.

The Subject Of The Message

You are allowed to enter up to 53 characters to describe the content of 
the message.  If you do not enter a subject for the message, the message 
you are entering will be aborted.  You will usually want to sum up your 
message in the subject of the message.

Assigning Message Security

Unless you have defined the current conference to make all message private, 
you will be asked what type of message security they would like to use.  You 
may choose to make the message public so that other users on the system may 
read it, or you may choose to make the message private so that the message is 
viewable by a limited number of people.

To make things easier, you will be asked to enter a letter that corresponds 
with the type of security to use for the message. If you press R, the message 
will be made public for others to read.  The message security options and 
their corresponding letters are:

    D           Pack-out date.  This option gives you the ability to set a 
                date at which the message will be deleted or packed-out if it 
                is still active.  As long as the message is not killed first, 
                the message will then remain active until the date specified 
                is reached.

                The message that is to be entered will be a public message. 
                This makes it useful for letting your users know about 
                special announcements and such.  If you need to change the 
                message security, you may do so by editing the message header 
                or by using either the U or P subcommand at the End of 
                Message Command prompt.

                Only those who have security clearance to set the pack-out 
                date (PCBSetup | Security Levels | Sysop Commands) may enter 
                messages of this type.  Furthermore, those having sufficient 
                security will be shown the pack-out date at the bottom of the 
                message.

    G           Group password.  When this message security is selected, you 
                will be asked for a password to protect the message with.  In 
                order for anyone to read the contents of the message they 
                must know the password.

    N           None.  Choosing this message security enables anyone that can 
                read messages in the conference that the message was left in 
                to read the message.  This message security may be used to 
                make general announcements or to get input or replies from a 
                wide group of users.

    R           Receiver only.  Only the person to whom the message is 
                addressed and the sender of the message may read a message 
                that has been marked as receiver only.  This is the most 
                common way to send private messages.

    S           Sender password.  This message security also asks for a 
                password.  The password is used Anyone may read this message 
                but only the person who entered the message may kill the 
                message. Normally the receiver and the sender can kill the 
                message.

NOTE:  The SysOp with user record #1 can always kill a message. They may also 
read any message regardless of the protection if their security level is 
higher than the Security Required to Read All Messages in PCBSetup | Security 
Levels | Sysop Commands.  

Requesting A Return Receipt

If you are entering a RECEIVER ONLY message and have sufficient security as 
specified in the second conference configuration screen of PCBSetup, you will 
be asked if you would like a return receipt.  When the recipient reads the 
message, a return receipt will be generated which will notify you that they 
have read the message.

The return receipt that you receive will display the message number that it 
was generated from and who it was addressed to. Also included in the return 
receipt message is the date and time that the message was read.

Echoing a Message

Some bulletin board systems participate in an activity called echo-mail. This 
allows messages to be shared between several different bulletin board 
systems.  By sharing messages across a network, users can get a wider variety 
of responses and usually will have more mail to read.

If you are entering a message in a conference that is designated as an 
echo-mail conference, you will be asked if the want the message to be echoed.  
If so, the message will go to the rest of the bulletin board systems that are 
echoing the conference. Otherwise, the message will remain on the current 
bulletin board only.

Routing A Message

If you have a conference which is set to echo mail you can prompt for routing 
information for any RECEIVER ONLY message. The routing information will only 
be asked for if the message being left is a RECEIVER ONLY message.  Each mail 
network may have a different method of routing mail or may not support the 
routing of messages.

If the user responds to a message which has origin information they will 
not be asked to enter routing information as that will come from the 
origin information.

Choosing a Message Editor

If you choose, PCBoard will ask if you wish to use the full-screen message 
editor each time you enter a message.  If you find that you always use the 
full-screen editor or you always use the line-editor, use the W user command 
to change your answer to the Use Full Screen Editor question.  If you select 
A, you will be given the following options each time you enter a message:

    Y           Yes.  If you select this option you will use the full-screen 
                editor to enter your message.  For more information on the 
                full-screen editor, see The Full-Screen Editor.

    N           No.  If you choose this option you will use the line-editor 
                instead of the full-screen editor to enter the message.  For 
                more information on the line editor, please see The 
                Line-Editor.

    U           Upload mode.  This is identical to selecting any message 
                editor and then selecting the U command available from within 
                Commands Available While in a Message Editor.

Commands Available While in a Message Editor

There are certain commands that are available in both message editors. 
We will call these commands message entry commands. These commands 
enable you to save a message, quote a message, and more.  To access 
these commands in the full-screen editor, press ESC or CTRL-U.  To access 
these commands in the line-editor, press ENTER on a blank line.

    A           Abort message.  Aborts the current message entry and 
                returns to the command prompt.
        
    C           Continue message using line-editor.  Continue the 
                message using the line-editor.

    D           Delete a line.  Enables you to delete any line by line 
                number.  If you are using the full-screen editor, you 
                can use CTRL-Y to delete the current line.

    E           Edit a line.  Enables you to edit any line in the 
                message. Once the line number to edit has been entered, 
                you are asked for the text to replace followed by a 
                semicolon, and finally the replacement text.  For 
                example, if you want to replace the word halp with the 
                word help, you would type halp;help.  Editing text in 
                the full-screen editor is even easier because you can 
                move the cursor around and toggle insert/overwrite mode.

    F           Edit message using full-screen editor.  Continue editing 
                the message using the full-screen editor.

    H           Help.  Enables you to access on-line help for entering a 
                message.

    I           Insert a line.  Enables you to insert lines after the 
                line number specified.  Each line is inserted one at a 
                time.  The insertion stops when you press ENTER on a blank 
                line.  In the full-screen editor, you may use CTRL-N to 
                insert a new line in the message.

    L           List current message.  If you are using the line editor, 
                you can list the current message showing all line 
                numbers and the contents of the message by using this 
                command.  This command allows you to preview the message 
                and to obtain line numbers that you may want to modify.

    Q           Quote message.  When replying to a message you can quote 
                from the original message to make the reply clearer.  
                You may quote as many lines as desired.  When prompted, 
                enter the beginning and ending line number that you wish 
                to quote.  These lines are then brought into the message 
                with each line being preceded by a -> to show it is a 
                quote.  This command only works when the current message 
                is a reply.

                NOTE:  Local users may also quote a message by using 
                PCBoard's scroll back feature.  For more information 
                about using PCBoard's scroll-back to quote message see  
                the REPLY user command later in this chapter.

    S           Save message.  Once the message is complete it can be 
                saved using this command.  Once the message has been 
                saved, you are returned back to the command prompt.

    SA          Save and attach a file.  You can attach a file to a 
                message. When a file is attached to a message users that 
                can read the message can also flag the file for 
                download.  Using this method, two or more individuals 
                can share a file that might be relevant to the message 
                being entered.  When you attach a file, you will be 
                asked for a protocol to use and also for the filename.  
                If the transfer is successful, the file will be attached 
                and the message will be saved.  If the upload is not 
                successful, you will be returned to the message command 
                prompt.

    SC          Carbon copy message.  If a message needs to be sent to 
                several people, you can use this command to copy the 
                message to other users.  When this command is executed, 
                you are asked for the other users that the message 
                should be addressed to.  For each new addressee, a new 
                message is saved with the same subject, message 
                security, and message body.

    SN          Save message and goto next message.  Normally when you 
                save a reply to a message, you are returned back to the 
                message that you replied to.  If you do not want to 
                return to the message and would like to continue with 
                the next message, use this command to save the message.

    SK          Save message and kill original.  When replying to a 
                message, you may want to kill the original message.  If 
                so, use this command.  If you are not able to kill the 
                message (due to a lack of security), you will not be 
                able to kill the message either.

    U           Upload a message.   To upload a prepared message into 
                the message editor, use this command.  PCBoard will 
                prompt you for the protocol to use to upload the 
                prepared message.  Once a protocol has been selected, 
                you will be informed that PCBoard is ready to begin 
                their upload.  Upload the message as you would upload 
                any other file to your system.  When the transfer is 
                complete, the message will be checked for line lengths.  
                If any line in the imported message is in excess of 79 
                characters, PCBoard will not allow you to edit the 
                message.  Instead, you may only save the message as it 
                was uploaded.

Using the Message Editors

After you have addressed the message and assigned the message security, 
the message editor will be displayed.  There are two different message 
editors -- the full screen editor and the line editor.  The full-screen 
editor is more like a word processor where you can move the cursor 
around the screen while the line-editor allows you to edit or enter the 
message one line at a time.

The Full-Screen Editor

To effectively use the full-screen message editor, you should 
familiarize yourself with the control keys and special keys that can be 
used within the editor.  Besides the list that is provided in this 
manual you may obtain the same help by pressing CTRL-Z while in the 
full-screen editor.

When logged in locally, use the keys shown in the PC-Keyboard column.  
If you are logged in remotely, the same keystrokes may or may not work 
depending on the communications program being used.  Some communication 
program have a command which will enable DOORWAY mode.  This mode allows 
you to use all of the cursor keys, and other keys from remote.  If the 
communications program you are using does not support this mode, you may 
have to use the Control-Key equivalents instead.

Toggle 79 column mode                                     CTRL-_ 


The Line-Editor

The line editor commands are described in the Commands Available While 
in a Message Editor section.  Because the full-screen editor requires 
that you have ANSI terminal capabilities, you may choose to use the 
line-editor instead.  The only editing that can be done while typing in 
a line in the line-editor is to backspace and correct typing mistakes. 
Otherwise, all editing must be done with the commands described in the 
Commands Available While in a Message Editor section.

In order to enter a blank line in the line-editor, press SPACE on a 
blank line and then press ENTER.  Otherwise, pressing ENTER on a blank 
line will display the message entry command prompt.

Entering Your Message

When entering a message, continue typing without worrying about 
formatting or pressing ENTER at the end of lines.  PCBoard will wrap the 
text that is written so that whole words remain on one line. If you lose 
carrier or are logged off for inactivity, PCBoard will save the message. 
This message can later be edited by using the EDIT subcommand at the End 
of Message Command while reading the message.

F   File Directories

This command enables you to list files in the current conference, and to 
find a particular file either by filename or by text in the file 
description.

Subcommands to Locate a File

Usually you will want to filter the list of files that are seen. You may 
pick any of the subcommands listed in the following table to control 
which files are displayed to them.  The L and N subcommands can be 
combined as well as the Z and N subcommands. The L and Z commands may 
not be combined.    See Examples for more details.

All of the subcommands in this section may also be accessed as
commands right from the main menu.  Expert users will find that
accessing this commands directly from the main menu is the
fastest way.

    L           Locate filename(s).
    N           Display files after a particular date.
    Z           Search entire file listing for text.
    
File Directory Subcommands

You should pick one or more of these subcommands to determine
which file directories to view.  If you pick more than one
subcommand, each must separated by a SPACE or a ;.  See Examples for
more details.

    [dir. #]    File directory number.
    P           View private upload directory.
    U           View public upload directory.

Miscellaneous Subcommands

    D           Flag the files found for download.
    FLAG        Flag a file for download by filename.
    G           Log off of the BBS. 
    NS          Display listing in non stop mode.
    R           Re-display available file directories.
    V           View a file.

Subcommands (Alphabetical)

    [dir. #]    File directory number.  Specifies the file directory 
                number(s) that you want to view.  If you want to view 
                multiple file directories, enter each directory number 
                separated by either a SPACE or a ; character.

    D           Flag the files found for download.  Any files that are 
                listed to the screen will also be flagged for download.  
                No warning is given if you exceed the batch file limit.  
                In other words, if you can batch transfer no more than 
                20 files then only the first 20 files that are displayed 
                will be flagged for download.  The rest of the files 
                will still be displayed but they will not be flagged.

    FLAG        Flag a file for download by filename.  Enables you to 
                flag any file by typing in the filename.  A single 
                filename may be typed or wildcard characters may be used 
                to flag multiple files with similar filenames.

    G           Log off the BBS.  Immediately disconnects you from the 
                system.
     
    L           Locate filename(s).  Enables you to display only those 
                files which match a particular filename.  Any valid DOS 
                filename may be entered including those with wildcard (? 
                and *) characters.

    N           Display files after a particular date.  Quite frequently 
                you will want to scan the file directories to see what 
                new files have been recently put online.  PCBoard uses 
                the N subcommand to display files that were posted after 
                the date that you enter. The default date will always be 
                the latest date seen in the file directories.  You can 
                specify another date by stacking the date after the N 
                subcommand or PCBoard will prompt you for the date. To 
                specify the default date on the command line use S to 
                represent the date.

    NS          Display listing in non-stop mode.  When this subcommand 
                is used the file listings will be displayed in non-stop 
                mode.  This command may also enter this subcommand at 
                any more? prompt while displaying the file listings.

    P           View private upload directory.  This subcommand enables 
                you to view the private upload directory of the current 
                conference. In order to use this subcommand you must 
                have a security level that is equal to or greater than 
                the one that is entered in PCBSetup | Security Levels | 
                Sysop Commands.

    R           Re-display available file directories.  This subcommand 
                will re-display the list of file directories that are 
                available in the current conference.

    U           View public upload directory.  When files are uploaded 
                they go either to the private upload directory if you 
                force all uploads to be private--otherwise, they are 
                stored in the public upload directory.  This subcommand 
                enables you to view a list of files and descriptions 
                that are in the public upload directory of the current 
                conference.

    V           View a file.  Sometimes you may want more detailed 
                information about a particular file.  When this 
                subcommand is used you will be asked for the filename to 
                view.  If the filename is a valid filename PCBVIEW.BAT 
                will be executed.  This is a batch file that you can use 
                to customize what information you see about that 
                particular file.  For more information about PCBVIEW.BAT 
                please see the Batch Files chapter of this manual.

    Z           Search entire file listing for text.  A user may select 
                only those files which contain particular text.  Like 
                other search functions in PCBoard, you may use Boolean 
                operands for more complex searching.  For more 
                information on Boolean operands please see Searching For 
                Text in the Sysop's Guide chapter of this manual. 

Description

File transfers are one of the most popular attractions to bulletin 
boards.  You may wish to view a list of files that are on the system to 
see if there are files that you wish to download or to make sure that a 
particular file is not already online.

When the user presses F to access the file directories a list of file 
directories that may be viewed will be listed on the screen.  After the 
list is displayed, you are given a file command prompt where you can use 
any of the previously listed subcommands to control what files are 
listed/downloaded.

Examples

To view all of the files that are available in file directory
number 3, you would enter:

F 3

To view the contents of ANYFILE.TXT, you would enter:

F V ANYFILE.TXT


FLAG for Download

This command enables you to mark a file or group of files for
download later during your call.

Subcommand

[Filename]      The filename or filenames to flag or mark for download 
                later.  You can enter multiple filenames by using 
                standard DOS wildcards or by typing multiple filenames 
                separated with a SPACE or a ;.

Description

Sometimes you may want to flag or mark a file for download but do not 
want to begin the transfer right away.  By flagging a file, PCBoard will 
remember the filename(s) until you are ready to begin the download.  
There are several ways that you can flag a file for download:

At the conference command prompt by using the FLAG command

While listing files with the F, Z, or N commands.  PCBoard adds an 
additional prompt on each  more? prompt which enables you to flag a 
file.

Using the FLAG subcommand of the F user command.

Once the transfer has begun, all of the files that are being downloaded 
are remembered in case the transfer is aborted.  Any files that were not 
transferred completely will remain flagged so that you may make another 
attempt at transferring them.  The only way to remove the flagged files 
is to either successfully download the files or to answer N to the 
Download Flagged Files? prompt.

G  Goodbye / Logoff of the BBS

To disconnect properly from the BBS, use this command.

Subcommands

Y               Yes.  If you have files flagged for download or if you 
                have enabled the Warning on Logoff Command, you will be 
                warned before logoff.  If you use this subcommand, 
                PCBoard will not warn you.

Description

When you disconnect from a system, you "terminate the connection".  Once 
disconnected, you can call other systems or perform other tasks.  
Although you can issue G;Y to skip the Proceed with logoff? question, 
you may also  use the BYE command.  This command is usually easier to 
remember than G;Y and is generally recommended

H   Online Help

This command lets you explicitly access the on-line help system. Using 
this command, you can get help for any of the commands available on the 
main menu.

Subcommand

    [command]   The command or filename that you want additional 
                assistance with.

Description

Each of PCBoard's main commands have additional assistance available in 
the form of on-line help.  The on-line help will be displayed on the 
screen.

Adding Help For Custom Commands

To add help files for commands that you add to the system or for doors 
on your system, you can create a filename in your help subdirectory that 
comprise of the first 8 characters of the command.  PCBoard will display 
the help file if it exists.

Example

If you add a command called ORDER to your system, create a file called 
ORDER and place it in your help subdirectory.  Execute the following to 
get help with your ORDER command:



HELP ORDER

I   Initial Welcome

If you wish to review the welcome screen that was displayed to you when 
you first logged into the system, use this command. Any user may issue 
this command regardless of security level.

J   Join a Conference

Conferences serve as a way to separate information and topics on a 
bulletin board system.  By dividing up the information, you can find 
what you are after quicker than ever before.

Subcommands : Alphabetical Listing

[conf. name]    Conference name to join.  Specifies the conference name 
                you wish to join.  Joining a conference by name is 
                useful when you do not remember conference numbers, or 
                in case the conference is moved to a new number.

[conf. num.]    Conference number to join.  Specifies the conference 
                number you wish to join.

Q               Quick-join the conference.  Sometimes the conference 
                that is being joined will have a news or introduction 
                file.  This subcommand will make sure that these files 
                are not displayed when the conference is joined.

S               Search conference names for text.  As pointed out 
                earlier, you may want to join a conference by name 
                instead of number. What if you do not know or remember 
                the conference names?  This subcommand enables you to 
                search the conference names on a system for text.  When 
                prompted for text to search for, enter the text you wish 
                to search for.  If a match is found in the conference 
                name then both the conference name and number will be 
                displayed.

Description

Conferences provide a method which information on the bulletin board 
system can be broken down into areas.  Each conference can have unique 
file directories, message bases, scripts, bulletins, and doors, or it 
may share these with other conferences on the system.  In order to go to 
one of these conferences, use this command.  Once you join the 
conference all of the features of the conference are made available to 
you.

Examples

If you want to join conference number 13, enter the following at the 
conference command prompt:

J;13

If you know the name of the conference instead of the number of
the conference, type in the name of the conference to join.  For
example, if you want to join the Computer_Art conference then
you would type:

J;COMPUTER_ART

If you do not know either the conference name or the conference
number, use the search subcommand to help you find the right
conference.  For example, you may only remember that the
conference deal with art.  In that case, type the following at
the conference command prompt:

J;S;ART

PCBoard will  search the conference names to see if it could
find a match.  For this particular example, you may see a report
like the following:

1) Classic_Art
13) Computer_Art
37) Digitized_Art

The number to the left is the conference number and the
conference name is listed to the right.  You can then pick the
conference number or name that you wish to join.

K   Kill a Message

This command will mark a message for deletion making any message
inactive and unreadable.  The actual message is not physically
removed until that message base is packed.

Subcommand

[msg. num.]     The message number you wish to kill or make inactive.  
                This subcommand is only available if you are issuing the 
                K command from a conference command prompt.

Description

Eventually messages on your system will become outdated or no longer 
useful.  You can delete any message on your system by using this 
command.  When you kill a message you make it inactive but do not 
actually remove it from your system.  In order to physically remove an 
inactive message from your system you need to pack the message base.

There are only two prompts where you may delete a message.  At any 
conference command prompt and at the read message prompt.

If a message has a security option of RECEIVER ONLY,  the recipient and 
the sender of the message are the only ones that may kill it.  If a 
message is marked as SENDER PASSWORD, only the author of the message may 
kill it.  Finally, on messages that are addressed as GROUP PASSWORD, 
only the users with the proper password may kill the message.  The SysOp 
may kill any message even if the message is protected via password.

Examples

If you are at an End of Message Command prompt, type K to make the 
current message inactive.

Sometimes you may already know the number of the message you wish to 
delete.  For example, if you wanted to delete message number 3292 in the 
current conference, type the following at the conference command prompt.

K 3292

LANG   Change Current Language

PCBoard has the ability to support multiple languages.  Use this command 
to switch to the language you wish to use for your prompts after you 
have logged into the system.

Subcommand

[language #]    The language number you wish to use.  If you omit the 
                language number a list of available languages will be 
                displayed to you.

Description

The LANGuage command allows switching to other languages which are 
available on the system.  These languages may vary from foreign 
languages to "humorous" type languages and even some that are dedicated 
to new callers.  Choices that are available are displayed in menu format 
with a number corresponding to each operational language choice.

Example

To change to language number 3 on the system. enter the following:

LANG 3

L   Locate a Filename

This command enables searching the file directories of the current 
conference for a particular filename.  Wildcard characters are 
permitted.

Subcommands: Alphabetical Listing

[#]             Directory #.  When using this command, you must specify 
                a directory or range of directories that PCBoard should 
                search for the desired file(s).  You may list a single 
                directory, a range of directories in the format [#-#] or 
                a list of directories in a [#;#;#] format.  There are 
                three letters you may use to represent special file 
                directories.  If you use A for the directory number, 
                PCBoard will search all file directories in the current 
                conference.  Likewise, if you use U for the directory 
                number, the upload directory of the current conference 
                will be searched.  Finally, if you have sufficient security, 
                you may use P to specify the private upload directory 
                for the current conference.

[filename.ext]  Filename to search for.  In order to search the file 
                directories for a filename you must supply the filename 
                you want PCBoard to search for.  The filename you 
                specify can be a simple filename like READTHIS.TXT, or 
                more frequently something that contains wildcard 
                characters like READ*.*.  The advantage in using 
                wildcard characters is that you are not required to know 
                the exact filename.

D               Flag the files for download that are found in the 
                search.  If a file that matches the parameters is 
                located, it is flagged and prepared for download later 
                during the call.  If more than one file is found, all 
                files will be flagged.

N               Combine the locate search with a new file scan.  This 
                subcommand will help limit your search by only searching 
                for files equal to or after a specific date.  If you use 
                the N command you also need to include the minimum file 
                date from which the scan should search for.  If you 
                would like to use the date you last scanned for files 
                you may simply add an S to the N subcommand.

NS              Display the files found in non-stop mode.  Files are 
                displayed in non-stop mode (no More? prompts will be 
                displayed).

Description

Quite often you will want to search the file directories on a BBS to 
determine if a particular file exists on the system.  If you are looking 
for a particular filename, you would use this command to help you find 
that filename.  Most of the time your search will include some sort of 
wildcard like TCRN*.* or similar.  If you attempt to search for HSXM, 
PCBoard will automatically append an *.* making the search criteria 
HSXM*.* to help you find the file(s) you are looking for.

Examples

If you want to locate any files that begin with ABC in all file 
directories for the current conference, type the following at the 
conference command prompt:

L;ABC;A

If you wanted to search for files that began with ABC in directories 1, 
3, 9, and 15, type in the following command:

L;ABC;1;3;9;15

If you found that two many files were showing up on your searches, you 
may want to restrict the files you search for by date.  To do this, you 
would use the N subcommand that was described previously.  For example, 
to search for any filename that begins with ABC in all directories but 
only show those that have a file date equal to or later than  10/21/93, 
type the following at the command prompt:

L;ABC;N;102193;A

M   Graphics Mode

This command will allow you to change the graphics mode between
RIPscrip, ANSI, non-ANSI, and no-color, graphics modes.

Subcommands: Alphabetical Listing

CTTY            Non-ANSI mode.  Everything displayed by PCBoard will be 
                in non-graphics, non-ANSI mode.  This is the usually the 
                safest mode for non-IBM computers like UNIX or 
                Macintosh.

ANSI            ANSI cursor positioning.  Everything displayed by 
                PCBoard will be in non-graphics, ANSI mode.  This allows 
                for faster screen drawing without having to slow down 
                the displays with the colors.

GRAPH           ANSI color and cursor positioning.  Everything displayed 
                by PCBoard will be in graphics, ANSI mode.  This means 
                that all prompts and text will be colorized.  This mode 
                is commonly referred to as graphics mode.

RIP             RIPscrip graphics mode.  If you have made RIPscrip 
                versions of your display files, they will be displayed 
                to users who have this mode enabled.  By entering ENTER at 
                the Do you want graphics prompt, this mode will be 
                enabled.

Description

Issued without subcommands, this command acts as a toggle between 
graphics and non-graphics display modes.  If you execute this command 
with a subcommand then you may choose which mode you want without using 
the command to toggle back and forth.  If you do not have ANSI 
capabilities or are unsure if you do, you should choose CTTY mode.  If 
you accidentally choose the wrong mode and you get what seems to be 
garbage on your screen you can enter the command again with the CTTY 
subcommand to see if that clears up things for you.

About RIPscrip

While most communications programs are capable of displaying ANSI 
graphics, not all are capable of showing RIPscrip graphics. If you 
choose RIPscrip and your communications program is not able to 
interpreted the codes, it will appear that garbage characters are 
displaying on the screen.  PCBoard itself, does not support the display 
of RIPscrip graphics on the local screen.  As the SysOp, you will always 
see the RIPscip codes being displayed rather than the more appealing 
graphics.

Examples

If you are in graphics, ANSI mode and you wish to switch to non-color 
mode, simply execute the M command.  It will change your mode.

If you want to switch to CTTY mode so that no ANSI sequences will be 
sent you can do so by typing the following at the conference command 
prompt:

M;CTTY

NOTE:  The only way to enable CTTY mode after you log in is via the M 
command and the CTTY subcommand.

MENU   Re-display Main Menu

This command will re-display the main menu.

Description

You can redisplay the main menu at the command prompt.  When executed, 
the main menu screen is displayed regardless of the expert status.

N   New File Scan

This command will locate any files that are new since the specified date 
in the directories that you specify.

Subcommands

[date]          This represents the date from which PCBoard begins a 
                search for all new files.  All files found are 
                displayed.

                NOTE:  If you pass the date on the command line (e.g., 
                N;030394;A) and you want to specify only the files since 
                your last scan then you would enter an S instead of an 
                actual date.

[directory #]   When using this command, you must specify a directory or 
                range of directories that PCBoard should search for the 
                desired file(s).  You may list a single directory, a 
                range of directories in the format [#-#] or a list of 
                directories in a [#;#;#] format.  There are two letters 
                you may use as a directory number.  If you use A for the 
                directory number, it tells PCBoard to search all file 
                directories in the current conference.  Likewise, if you 
                use U for the directory number, the upload directory of 
                the current conference will be searched.

D               All files found are queued for later download during 
                your call.  To download the files that have been queued, 
                execute a download using either the D or DB commands.

S               PCBoard scans for files added since the date of the most 
                recent files the caller has been shown.  PCBoard keeps 
                track of the most recent valid file date that you have 
                seen in the file directories.  For example, if you were 
                to do a new scan searching all file directories on 
                12-24-94, but the latest file date that was displayed 
                was 12-21-94, PCBoard will remember that the latest date 
                you have seen is 12-21-94.

NS              Files are displayed in non-stop Mode (no More? prompts 
                are displayed).

Description

A system commonly has hundreds or thousands of files online. Rather than 
viewing each of these directories and attempting to pick out the new 
files, use this command to limit the files that are displayed by date.  
Using the subcommands you will have control over the date to begin the 
search and the directory or directories that you would like to search 
for new files.

Examples

One of the most common searches is to find new files in all directories 
of the current conference.  To perform this search, you would type the 
following at a conference command prompt:

N;S;A

If you wanted to only scan the upload directory for files that have a 
date which is equal to or greater than 07-19-93, type the following at a 
conference command prompt:

N;071993;U

A more complex search may specify only a few of the available file 
directories in the conference.  As an example, if you want to scan for 
new files since 05-22-94 in directories 1-4,. 15, and 20-25, type the 
following at the conference command prompt:

N;052294;1-4;15;20;25

NEWS   Display System News

Allows you to view the system news file which may list important events 
or notices about the bulletin board system.

Description

The news file usually contains important notes or events regarding the 
bulletin board system.  You may use this command to read the news file 
for the current conference.  Normally, this file is displayed when you 
log on to the system or join a conference but you may read it at any 
time by using this command.

NODE   Chat With Other Users

This command is identical to the CHAT command.  See the detailed 
explanation of the  command for further details.

O   Operator Page

If the SysOp is available for chat, this command will allow you to page 
the SysOp for chat.  If the SysOp is not available, you will be given 
the opportunity to leave a comment.

Description

This command enables you to request an immediate chat with the SysOp.  
If the system operator is available, both your machine and the SysOp's 
will beep for 30 seconds or until the page is answered, in which case 
you enter SysOp chat.  If, however, the SysOp does not answer the page 
or is unavailable at the time of your request, PCBoard will inform you 
that the SysOp is unavailable and asks if you would like to leave a 
comment instead.  The time when the SysOp is available can be configured 
in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Limits. 

OPEN a DOOR

This command allows you to open a DOOR to another application. You may 
open a door via door number or by name.

Subcommands

[door #]        This represents the number of the DOOR to open.  It may 
                either be stacked with the command at the conference 
                command prompt (e.g., OPEN;1) or chosen after the DOOR 
                menu is displayed.

[door name]     Instead of the DOOR number, you may type the actual DOOR 
                name.  For example, to open a door called 'EXCITING' you 
                could type OPEN;EXCITING from the conference command 
                prompt.

NOTE:           If you use the name to open a door then you can type 
                just the name of the door at the conference command 
                prompt.  For example if you have a door called MAIL, 
                type MAIL at the conference command prompt to open the 
                door.

[parameter]     You may pass a parameter to the DOOR that is called. 
                This parameter is similar to one passed at a DOS prompt 
                to another application.  Not all DOOR programs accept 
                parameters so unless a particular DOOR states that it 
                will accept parameters, assume that it does not.  As an 
                example, if you were to open a door by typing 
                OPEN;SALES;ANYTHING, you would be opening a DOOR called 
                SALES and ANYTHING would be passed as a parameter.  To 
                access the parameters in a DOOR batch file you need to 
                read the PCBDOOR environment variable.  See the Doors 
                section of the Conference Setup chapter in this manual 
                for further details. 

Description

A DOOR can extend a BBS because a DOOR is more or less an application 
that is independent of the bulletin board system. For example, a door 
could be an on-line game or an on-line database.  If you do not specify 
a door number or name to open, the door menu is displayed so that you 
may pick a door to open.

P   Page Length Setting

Allows you to change the number of lines that PCBoard should think is on 
your display screen.  

Subcommand

[# of lines]    This number indicates the number of lines displayed per 
                screen.  This value may range between 0 and 99.

Description
              
You may specify the number of lines PCBoard displays before it prompts 
you with a (H)elp, More? line.  The most common setting is 23, but you 
may choose any value between 0 and 99.  If you select a page length 
setting of 0, it is like being in permanent non-stop mode (i.e., when the 
screen fills up,  a More? prompt will not be displayed).

Q   Quick Message Scan

This command will list message header information.  The information 
pertaining to a message is listed on one line for easy viewing.

Display Subcommands

+		Scan in forward direction.
-		Scan in reverse direction.
L		Begin with last message in message base.
NS              Display in non-stop mode.

Message Selection Subcommands

[beg. msg.  #]  Beginning message number.
A               Scan selected conferences.
ALL             Scan all conferences.
F               Message from you.
FROM            Read messages from a user.
N               New Messages by date.  
S               Messages that you have not read yet.
TO              Read messages to a user.
WAIT            Scan messages in conferences where you have mail waiting.
TS              Messages that contain particular text.
U               All unread messages.
USER            Messages from a particular user.
Y               Messages addressed to you.

Subcommands: Alphabetical Listing

[beg. msg.  #]  Beginning message number.  This is the message number 
                that you wish to begin the scan with.  The default scan 
                direction is in the forward direction.  If you wish to 
                go in the reverse direction, use the - subcommand.

+               Scan in forward direction.  When appended to the 
                beginning message number you can set the direction in 
                which PCBoard scans the message base.  For example if 
                you enter 762+, PCBoard will begin scanning at message 
                number 762 in the forward direction.

-               Scan in reverse direction.  When appended to the 
                beginning message number you can set the direction in 
                which PCBoard scans the message base.  For example if 
                you enter 3569-, PCBoard will begin scanning at message 
                number 3569 in the reverse direction.

                NOTE:  PCBoard defaults to searching in the forward direction.

A               Scan selected conferences.  Scans not only the current 
                conference but also those conferences which you have set 
                for scanning via the SELECT command or the S conference 
                flag in the users record.

ALL             Scan all conferences.  Scans all conferences you are 
                registered in even if you have not marked the conference 
                for scanning.

F               Message from you.  Only messages that are from you, the 
                user currently online, will be displayed.

FROM            Read messages from a user.  If you wish to read mail 
                that is from a particular user, use this subcommand.  
                When you use this subcommand, PCBoard will prompt you 
                for the user you wish to read mail from.

L               Begin with last message in message base.  Sets the 
                beginning message number to the last message in the 
                message base.  When you use this subcommand you may omit 
                the beginning message number.

N               New messages by date.  The first message that is read is 
                the one that matches the date that you specify.  This 
                enables you to read only messages that were left after a 
                certain date.

NS              Display in non-stop mode.  The listing of messages will 
                be displayed in non-stop mode.  This means that there 
                will be no more? prompts to pause each time the screen 
                becomes full.

S               Messages that you have not read yet.  Searches only 
                those messages that you have not read yet.

TO              Read messages to a user.  If you wish to read mail that 
                is addressed to a particular user, use this subcommand.  
                When you use this subcommand, you will be prompted for 
                the user name that you wish to read mail from.

TS              Messages that contain particular text.  This subcommand 
                enables you to search for text in the message body, the 
                TO: field, and the FROM: field.  You can search for a 
                word/phrase or you can use any Boolean search.  For more 
                information on searching for text please see Searching 
                For Text in the Sysop's Guide chapter of this manual.

U               All unread messages.  If a message has not yet been read 
                then it will be displayed.

                NOTE:  A message that is addressed to ALL will always 
                show up in such a search because the read status is not 
                maintained on a message addressed to all users on the 
                system.

USER            Messages from a particular user.  You may search the 
                message header for a particular user.  When PCBoard 
                searches for a particular user it will search both the 
                TO: and FROM: fields in the message header.  You must 
                enter a full user name.  Partial matches cannot be made 
                with this command.

WAIT            Scan messages in conferences where you have mail 
                waiting. Messages are read from only conferences that 
                you currently have personal mail waiting to be read.  
                For example, if you login and see that you have mail 
                waiting in conferences 2,3, and 25 you could read all 
                new messages in only those conferences by entering 
                R;WAIT at the conference command prompt.

Y               Messages addressed to you.  Only messages that are 
                addressed to you will be listed.
                
Description
      
You may analyze a brief list of messages that may be read by you if you 
use the Q user command.  When executed, PCBoard will display the 
following information about each message:

Message number
Reference number
Sender
Addressee
Subject
Read Status

The reference number indicates the previous message to which a reply was 
entered to.  This command can be used to quickly search message headers for 
information.

Format of the list

The list that is produced by the format contains the following information:

Msg #.  The actual message number in the message base.  Just before the 
message number is a status code that shows if the message has been read, etc.  
For a list of status codes please see the section titled Status Codes.

Ref #.   If the message is a reply, this field will contain the message 
number which was replied to.

To.  Displays who the message is addressed to.  Only the first 16 characters 
of who a message is address to is displayed in this list.

From.  Displays who the message is from.  The first 16 characters of who the 
message(s) are from will be displayed.

Subject.  Displays the subject of the message.  Even though a subject may be 
quite long, only the first 25 characters of the subject is displayed with 
this command.

Status Codes

Next to each message number is a status code.  You can use these status codes 
to determine if the message has been read, if it has replies, etc.  The 
following is a list of all valid message status codes:

    [blank]     A message which can be read by anyone.
    *           A private message to a specific person which has not been 
                read by the person it was addressed to.
    +           A private message which has been read by the person it was 
                addressed to.
    -           A message to a specific person, which was readable by anyone, 
                which has been read by the person it was addressed to.
    ~           A comment to the SysOp which has not been read by the person
                defined as SysOp record #1.
    `           A comment to the SysOp which has been read by the person
                defined as SysOp record #1.
    %           A message protected by sender password which has not been read.
    ^           A message protected by sender password which has been read.
    !           A message protected by group password which has not been read.
    #           A message protected by group password which has been read.
    $           A message protected by group password which is addressed to
                ALL.

Examples

To display the header information for all messages in the current message 
base in reverse order you would issue the following at the command prompt:

Q L

To search for all messages (beginning with the first message in
the message base) either to or from a user named Wally Peterson
you would issue the following at the command prompt:

Q USER WALLY PETERSON 1+

QWK   Transfer Main In QWK Format

This command will capture messages and create a QWK packet that
can be downloaded and read off-line.  This command can also be used to
upload any reply packets that you may have.

Subcommands : Alphabetical Listing

[protocol]      If a protocol is not specified for transferring the QWK 
                (mail) or REP (reply) packet, the default protocol will be 
                used.

BYE             When you use this subcommand, PCBoard will logoff after your 
                transfer is complete.  Use of this subcommand is ideal for 
                performing automated mail-runs.

U               This subcommand is used to upload a REP packet.

D               This subcommand is used to download a QWK packet.  PCBoard 
                scans the conferences that have been selected for scanning 
                with the SELECT user command.

Description

To save time and money, a common practice is to transfer mail packets to and 
from a bulletin board system.  The messages can then be read and replied to 
off-line.  PCBoard will create a QWK mail packet when using this command.  In 
addition, the REP file can be uploaded with this command when using the U 
subcommand.

If you do not specify any subcommands when executing the command you will
be asked if you will be downloading or uploading a mail packet.  Choose
the appropriate response for the action your desire.

Examples

To download a QWK packet using the Z protocol, the following would be 
entered:

QWK D Z

If there are replies to the QWK packet they will be stored in a REP file.  
This file needs to be uploaded for the replies to be posted on the bulletin 
board system.  The following command would prepare PCBoard to upload the REP 
packet:

QWK U


R   Read Messages

The Read messages command permits you to read messages on a bulletin board 
system.  Messages may be addressed to you, or to other people.  From this 
command you may also reply to messages you are reading, search for text in 
messages, and get a synopsis of messages that are currently on the system.

Read: Selection Subcommands

The following is a list of what are called the selection subcommands.  These 
commands will determine the criteria for the messages that you will read.  
With the exception of the message #, you may use any subcommand in 
conjunction with any other subcommand.  For example, if you wanted to read 
new mail in all conferences that you have set for scanning, enter R;S;A. 
Likewise, if you wanted to read the same messages, but only display those 
from a user named FRANK CROSS, enter R;S;A;USER;FRANK CROSS at the conference 
command prompt.

    [Message #] Message number to read.
    A           Scan all selected conferences.
    ALL         Scan all conferences that you have access to.
    F           Read messages from current user.
    FROM        Read messages from a user.
    N           New Messages by date.  
    S           Read new messages.
    TO          Read messages to a user.
    TS          Search messages for specific text.
    U           Read unread messages.
    USER        Search messages to or from a particular user.
    WAIT        Scan messages in conferences where you have mail waiting.
    Y           Read messages addressed to you.
    YA          Read messages to you or to ALL.
    
Read: Scan Subcommands

These particular subcommands can be used to set the direction
that you will read mail.  For example, if you wanted to begin
reading at the end of the current message base, you would enter
R;L.

    + / -       Set read direction
    1+          Begin with first message in the message base.
    L           Begin with the last message.
    N           New messages by date.
    RM          Read memorized message.
    RM+         Read memorized message and continue reading forward.
    RM-         Read memorized message and continue reading reverse.

Read: Capture Subcommands

One time-saving feature that PCBoard offers is the ability to capture 
messages into one single file which you may download and browse off-line.  
The resulting file is an ASCII file that looks just like what you see on the 
screen when viewing messages.

Sometimes you may want to download a group of messages or just a single
message.  These subcommands allow you to capture messages and then download 
them to either a file or printer on your system.

    C           Capture messages
    D           Capture messages
    QWK         Capture messages to a QWK packet
    Z           Capture and compress messages

Read: General Subcommands


The following commands could be categorized as miscellaneous subcommands.  
Here, you will find commands to perform various functions that may not 
necessarily be directly related to reading messages, but are still available 
for your convenience.

    DE          De-select current conference
    G           Goodbye.
    J           Join a conference.
    K           Kill a message.
    LONG        Use the extended message header for displaying.
    NS          non-stop mode.
    O           Read-only mode.
    Q           Quick scan messages.
    SE          Select current conference for scanning.
    SET         Set the last message read number.
    SHORT       Use the brief message header for displaying.
    
End of Message: Scan Subcommands

After you read each message, PCBoard will display an End of Message Command 
prompt.  From this prompt you can enter numerous subcommands.  Most often, 
you will be entering subcommands which allow you to continue reading, 
memorizing the current message number, etc.  Following is a list of the 
subcommands you may access most frequently.

    [Message #] Message number to read
    R           Read next message in current direction
    +  /  -     Set read direction
    JUMP        Jump to the next conference.
    L           Begin with the last message.
    M           Memorize current message number.
    NEXT        Read next message.
    PREV        Read previous message.
    RM          Read memorized message.
    RM+         Read memorized message and continue reading forward.
    RM-         Read memorized message and continue reading reverse.
    RR          Read reference message.
    SKIP        Skip current conference.
    T+          Thread read (forward direction).  
    T-          Thread read (reverse direction).  

End of Message: Reply Subcommands

Communications is a two way street.  Therefore, you will most likely read 
messages which you wish to respond to.  The following is a list of reply 
subcommands that you can use to enter responses to messages.

    RE          Reply to current message.
    RO          Reply to a message but send reply to a different user.

End of Message: Capture Subcommands

If you are in the middle of reading messages and decide that you would like 
to capture the rest of the messages that you would have read into a text 
file, you may do so with the following subcommands.
          
    C           Capture current message
    D           Capture current message 
    Z           Capture and compress current message

End of Message: Selection Subcommands

While you are reading messages there are a few subcommands you can use to 
change the future messages you will be reading.  You can use these to make 
specific searches.  For example, if you began reading all new messages 
(R;A;S) and decided that there were too many messages, you should restrict 
your search.  If you decided that it would be faster to read mail addressed 
to you or ALL, enter YA at the End of Message Command prompt.

    F           Read messages from current user.
    S           Read new messages.
    TS          Search messages for specific text.

End of Message: SysOp Subcommands

There are several subcommands that are available only to SysOps at the End of 
Message Command prompt.  You can copy or move messages, access user records, 
edit message header information and more.

    COPY        Copy a message to another conference.
    F           Access the sender's user record.
    FF          Access the sender's user record.
    FT          Access the recipients user record.
    MOVE        Move message to another conference.
    P           Make current message private.
    U           Make current message public.

Subcommands: Alphabetical Listing

For your convenience, the following is a detailed alphabetical list of 
subcommands that are available with the R command.  Even the subcommands that 
are available at the End of Message Command prompt are listed.

[Message #]     Message number to read.  This number indicates the number of 
                the message that you wish to read.  If you wish, you may also 
                append either a + or a - to the message number to read in the 
                forward or reverse direction, starting with the message 
                number specified.  For example, to read message #3236 and 
                every message afterwards, you would enter 3236+ instead of 
                just 3236.

                You may also specify a range of message numbers by adding a 
                dash between the low message number and high message number.  
                For example, to specify messages between 3000 and 4000 , 
                enter 3000-4000.

(Enter)         Read next message in current direction.  When pressed at the 
                End of Message Command? prompt, the next message is displayed 
                in the direction that you are reading.

+  / -          Set read direction.  When appended to a message number or 
                used by itself, PCBoard displays all messages in 
                forward-numerical or reverse-numerical order respectively 
                from that point.  You can always tell what mode you are in by 
                looking at the Read Type at the top of the message you are 
                reading.  In that field you will see either a + or a - to 
                denote which direction you are reading.

/               Re-display current message.  When this subcommand is entered 
                at an End of Message Command prompt the message that was just 
                displayed will be re-displayed.

1+              Begin with first message in the message base.  If you want to 
                specify the first message in the message base you would 
                specify this subcommand.

A               Scan all selected conferences.  Messages are read from all 
                conferences that have been selected for scanning.  You may 
                choose which conferences you wish to scan for messages by 
                using the SE command at the conference command prompt or by 
                using  DE or SE with the R user command.  These conference 
                scanning flags may also be modified while editing a user 
                record.

ALIAS           Toggle usage of alias.  When you are in a conference that 
                allows usage of an alias, you may or may not want to enter 
                messages using your alias.  This command allows you to toggle 
                whether or not your alias will be used.

ALL             Scan all conferences that you have access to.  Messages are 
                read from all conferences that you have access to whether you 
                have selected them for scanning or not.

C               Capture messages.  The messages displayed by the current 
                command are captured, placed in a file, and prepared for 
                download.  You are given the choice to continue with the 
                download, abort the transfer, or hangup after the transfer.

COPY            Copy a message to another conference.  This subcommand for 
                SysOps enables copying of a message to another conference.  
                When you copy a message you leave the original message but 
                also make another copy of the message in the conference that 
                you specify.

D               Capture messages.   The messages displayed by the current 
                command are captured, placed in a file, and immediately 
                prepared for download.

DE              De-select current conference.  If a particular conference is 
                chosen for scanning, the conference is de-selected.  This has 
                the same effect as using the Select command from the main 
                menu and de-selecting the conference by pressing the 
                corresponding number for the conference.  This would cause 
                the "X" flag in the flags column from the SELECT command 
                (executed from a conference command prompt) to be removed.

E               Edit message header information.  At times, you may want to 
                change who you addressed a message to or the subject of a 
                message.  If this is the case, use the E subcommand to edit 
                those two fields of any message that you have entered.  If 
                you have SysOp security level, you may also change the 
                reference number, whether the message has been read yet, and 
                the protection of the message.  This subcommand is only 
                available at the End of Message Command? prompt.

E               Enter a message.  See the E user command for more details. 
                Note, this command is not available at the End of Message 
                Command? prompt.  See the previously described subcommand.

EDIT            Edit the content of a message.  The current message will be 
                placed in the editor for modification.  You may want to 
                re-edit a message if you accidentally lost carrier while 
                entering a message or changed your mind, etc.

F               Access the sender's user record.  As a SysOp, you may be 
                reading a message and want to access the user record of the 
                user who left the message.  This command will display the 
                user record of the user who left the message.  The format of 
                the user record and the commands that are available when the 
                user record is displayed are all discussed in the description 
                of the 7 SysOp command.

F               Read messages from current user.  The message base is scanned 
                for all messages from you.

FLAG            Flag a file for download.  Enables you to flag a file for 
                download later during the session.  This subcommand is 
                identical to the FLAG user command.

FF              Access the sender's user record.  See the F subcommand for 
                more details.

FROM            Read messages from a user.  If you wish to read mail that is 
                only from a particular user, use this subcommand.  When you 
                use this subcommand, PCBoard will prompt you for the user you 
                wish to read mail from.

FT              Access the recipients user record.  Like the F subcommand, 
                this subcommand allows you to access user records while you 
                are reading messages.  The difference, however, is that the 
                user record of the whom the message is addressed to will be 
                displayed.

G		GoodBye.  (See the G user command for more details.)

J               Join a conference.  You may join another conference.  (See 
                the J user command for more details.)

JUMP            Jump to the next conference.  If you read all conferences 
                (R;A or R;ALL), you may jump to the next available conference 
                for message base scanning by using this command.  The last 
                message read pointer is not advanced to the last message when 
                you jump a conference.  Next time you scan for new mail in 
                that conference, all of the messages you jumped over will be 
                shown in the scan.  This subcommand is only available at the 
                End of Message Command prompt.

K               Kill the current message.  If the message is to/from you then 
                you may kill it.  When you kill a message, you make it 
                inactive in the message base.  The SysOp may recover any 
                message which has been killed but not yet packed out of the 
                message base by using the 4 SysOp command.  If you do not 
                issue this command at an End of Message Command prompt, you 
                will be asked to enter the message number that you wish to 
                kill.

L               Begin with the last message.  The current message base is 
                read backward from the last message to the first.

LONG            Use the extended message header for displaying.  Displays the 
                extended message header.  All message header fields are 
                displayed, but the extended header uses 7 lines as opposed to 
                the 5 lines used by the short header display.

M               Memorize current message number.  When executed, PCBoard 
                memorizes the current message number.  PCBoard will only 
                remember one message number.  If you try to memorize another 
                message number, the previous one will be lost.  When you want 
                to return to the memorized message number, you may type RM, 
                RM+, or RM-.

MOVE            Move message to another conference.  This subcommand for 
                SysOps will move a message to another conference.  Moving 
                implies that the message will be copied to the conference 
                that you specify and then the original message will be 
                deleted.  When you use this subcommand you will be prompted 
                to enter the conference you wish to move the message to.  If 
                you enter the number of the conference you are currently in, 
                the message will be moved to the end of the current 
                conference's message base.

N               New messages by date.  The first message that is read is the 
                one that matches the date that you specify.  This enables you 
                to read only messages that were left after a certain date.

N               Quit reading messages.  At the End of Message command prompt, 
                reading ends and you are returned to the conference command 
                prompt.

NEXT            Read next message.  The next message in the message base is 
                displayed.

NS              non-stop mode.  Messages are displayed in non-stop mode, thus 
                eliminating More? prompts from the display.

O               Read messages in read-only mode.  When you want to read 
                messages and do not want your last message read updated as 
                you read the mail, read the mail in what is called read-only 
                mode. Additionally, if you have sufficient security as 
                defined in PCBSetup | Security Levels | Sysop Commands, the 
                message read status will not be updated.  This means that 
                even though you have read the message, it will not be shown 
                as having been read and your last message read pointers will 
                not be updated. 

P               Make current message private.  A quick way to make any 
                message security RECEIVER ONLY is to use this subcommand.  
                This subcommand is available to SysOps only and is quite 
                useful when you need to make a message private but do not 
                want to use the E subcommand to edit all of the message 
                header information.

PREV            Read previous message.  The previous message in the message 
                base will be displayed.

Q               Quick scan messages.  See the Q user command for more 
                information.

QWK             Capture message in QWK format.  One of the most popular 
                off-line message format is the QWK format.  With what is 
                called a QWK packet you can load it into an off-line mail 
                reader and read and reply to messages off-line saving time 
                and money.  If you use this subcommand, any message that 
                would have normally been displayed to your screen will be 
                sent to a QWK packet that you may download and read off-line.

RM              Read memorized message.  The message previously memorized is 
                re-displayed.

RE              Reply to current message.  When you wish to respond to an 
                individual's message you enter a message called a reply.  To 
                enter a reply to the current message you use the RE command 
                which will create a new message addressed to the sender of 
                the original message.  This is the command you will be using 
                most often when replying to a message because the message 
                that you want to respond to is the message you are currently 
                reading. Therefore, you will not have to enter a message 
                number to respond to because you are currently reading the 
                message.  See the REPLY to Message command for additional 
                information.

RM+             Read memorized message and continue reading forward.  The 
                message previously memorized is re-displayed and the message 
                base is placed in forward mode for further reading.

RM-             Read memorized message and continue reading reverse.  The 
                message previously memorized is re-displayed and the message 
                base is placed in reverse mode for further reading.

RR              Read reference message.  If the message you are reading 
                displays a message number in the REFER# field of the message 
                header, you may read the reference message by typing RR and 
                pressing the ENTER key.  This is also where the memorize a 
                message command (M) comes in handy.  Using that command you 
                can memorize the current message, read the reference message 
                and then quickly return to the original message by returning 
                to the memorized message number.

S               Read new messages.  All messages in the current conference 
                that have not already been read will be displayed.  You may 
                specify the A or ALL subcommand to scan for new mail in other 
                conferences besides the current conference.

SE              Select current conference for scanning.  While reading a 
                message you may select the current conference to scan for 
                messages.  This has the same effect as if you executed the 
                Select command from the main menu and placed an "X" in the 
                flags column.  Using this command you may select the 
                conferences you wish to scan for mail on-the-fly.

SET             Set the last message read number.  PCBoard stores last 
                message read pointers for each conference.  These pointers 
                contain the last message number that you read in any 
                particular conference.  By looking at this value, PCBoard is 
                able to determine which messages you have not read yet.  As 
                you read messages, this number will be automatically updated.  
                If you need to manually update this value, use this command.  
                When executed, you will be asked to enter the highest message 
                number that you have read.  Enter any valid message number 
                into the field.  If the number you enter is higher than the 
                highest message in the conference, your last message read 
                will be set to the highest number in the conference.

SHORT           Use the brief message header for displaying.  Displays the 
                four line version of the message header.  This means that not 
                all of the fields in the header are displayed so that more of 
                the message will be displayed on the screen.

SKIP            Skip current conference.  While executing an R;ALL or an R;A 
                command, you may use SKIP to bypass the remaining messages in 
                the current conference and to set the last message read 
                pointer to the last message.  In the R;A  case, however, 
                invoking SKIP will act just as it does with the R;A command 
                only it moves you to the next available conference and 
                permits you to continue reading messages in the next 
                conference.

T               Thread read.  PCBoard allows you to read only messages that 
                have the same subject in the message header.  This is called 
                reading messages by thread.  You may choose to read forward 
                or reverse in the thread by appending a + or a - next to the 
                T (e.g. T+, T-). Normally, you memorize your current position 
                (by using the M command) and use  the RM command to return to 
                the original message after the thread read is complete.

TO              Read messages to a user.  If you wish to read mail that is 
                addressed to a particular user, use this subcommand.  When 
                you do, you will be prompted for the user name that PCBoard 
                will use to search the TO: field of each message.

TS              Search messages for specific text.  Each message is scanned 
                for the text that you indicate.  You may perform complex text 
                searches by using Boolean text searches.  For more 
                information on Boolean text searches, refer to Searching For 
                Text in the Sysop's Guide chapter of this manual.

U               Read unread messages.  Anytime that you want to read messages 
                that have not been read, you can use this subcommand.  If a 
                message has been read by the recipient, PCBoard will display 
                the date and time that the message was read in the message 
                header. Messages to ALL will always be considered as unread.

U               Make current message public.  Like the P subcommand, this 
                subcommand allows you to quickly change the message security 
                of the current message.  However, this subcommand will make a 
                message a PUBLIC message.  This subcommand is only available 
                to SysOps since it is able to change the security of the 
                current message.

USER            Search messages to or from a particular user.  When executed 
                you are prompted to enter the name of the user you would like 
                to search for.  After you enter a valid user name, the 
                message base is scanned for messages both for a specified 
                user and those left by a specified user.

V               View a downloadable file.  Enables a downloadable file to be 
                viewed online via PCBVIEW.BAT.  This subcommand is identical 
                to the V subcommand for the F user command.  In other words, 
                it is identical to typing F;V at a conference command prompt.

WAIT            Scan messages in conferences where you have mail waiting. 
                Messages are read only from conferences that you currently 
                have personal mail waiting to be read.  For example, if you 
                login and see that you have mail waiting in conferences 2,3, 
                and 25 you could read all new messages in only those 
                conferences by entering R;WAIT at the conference command 
                prompt.

Y               Read messages addressed to you.  The message base is scanned 
                for all messages addressed to you.

YA              Read messages to you or to ALL.  The message base is scanned 
                for all messages addressed to you or to ALL.

Z               Capture and compress messages.  As with the D command, the 
                messages displayed by the current command are captured and 
                placed in a file.  The  file, however, is compressed before 
                it is downloaded and therefore may not be sent to your local 
                printer.

Description

Exchanging electronic mail or messages between users is probably the most 
popular form of communications on bulletin board systems.  Users will enter 
and read messages almost every call. PCBoard has several subcommands that 
allow you to read only those messages that interest you.

While the number of subcommands may overwhelm you at first, you will find 
that you will become familiar with them after a little bit of practice.  You 
may also find that using mnemonics will help you remember the commands 
easier.  By looking at the subcommands described earlier you would find that 
you could enter R;S;A at a conference command prompt to read all new messages 
in the conferences that you have selected for scanning. You may find it 
easier to remember that R;S;A means Read mail Since last time in All selected 
conferences.

Use the selection subcommands to determine the messages that you will read.  
After you read each message you will be presented with an End of Message 
Command prompt where you can enter other commands that enable you to reply to 
messages and other functions as well.

Combining Read Subcommands

Once you understand how you can combine the various read subcommands, you 
will be able to better make use of PCBoard's power.  The following section is 
designed to help you find the right subcommand for the right situation.

If you enter R at a conference command prompt you will see a line which shows 
you the range of the message numbers in the current conference message base 
and will ask you what Message Read Command you would like to use.  At this 
point, choose at least one subcommand from the Read: Selection Subcommands 
section.  For example, if you were to enter a Y, you are telling PCBoard to 
read messages that are addressed to you.  Now that PCBoard has enough 
information to go on, it will begin scanning with message #1 for any mail 
that is addressed to you.

You may be wondering what you would do if you did not want to begin scanning 
at message number one (m,aybe you only wanted to scan any new mail that is 
addressed to you).  What you would do in this case is use both the Y and the S 
subcommands.  Simply enter both subcommands at the Message Read Command 
prompt putting either a space ( SPACE ) or a  semicolon ( ; ) between each 
command.  The following is a sample scenario:

(50 min. left) Main Board Command? R

(H)elp, (3523-5032), Message Read Command? Y;S

At this point, PCBoard would begin scanning all new mail in the
current conference for any messages that are addressed to you.

The Difference Between LONG and SHORT Message Headers

The message header is the information that you are displayed regarding who 
the message is from or to, the subject of the message, etc.  PCBoard supports 
two different message headers -- long and short.

The long message header closely resembles the message header of previous 
versions of PCBoard with the exception that the, TO, FROM, and SUBJECT fields 
all take one line a piece.  The long message header displays the following 
information:

Date
Message number
Reference number (if message is a reply)
Who the message is address to
Who the message is from
The subject of the message
The security of the message
If the message has been read or not
The status of a message (has replies, message security, etc.)
Type of message read you are using

All in all, this format takes a hefty 7 display lines on the screen including 
the blank line between the header and the message text.  This amounts to 
nearly one third of the entire display area on the screen.  The short header, 
on the other hand, uses only 5 display lines including the blank line.  This 
amounts to less than one quarter of the display screen enabling you to fit 
more message text on the screen.  The short message header displays the 
following information:

Date and time the message was entered
Message number
If the message has replies (displayed as an R on the top line of the header)
If the message has been read (displayed as an * on the top line of the header)
Who the message is addressed to
Who the message is from
The subject of the message

The following shows the long message header style:











The following illustrates the short message header style









As you can see two lines of information really does make a difference.  The 
default header that is used is determined by how you answered the following 
question using the W user command:



Use long headers when reading messages? (Y)



You can also switch between long and short headers by typing either LONG or 
SHORT at the End of Message Command prompt.  In addition, you may also use 
these words when using the R user command.  For example:

R;A;LONG
R;Y;S;SHORT

Examples

If you do not like to read a lot of mail when you login to a system, you may 
want to only read new messages that are addressed to you in  all conferences 
that you are able to join. To do this, you would enter the following at the 
conference command prompt:

R;Y;S;ALL

If you wanted to read the same messages but instead you wanted to capture 
them to a file that you could download, you would enter the following 
instead:

R;Y;S;ALL;C

Sometimes you may want to search for messages that only have certain text in 
either the message header or the actual message body.  For, example, if you 
wanted to search all of the messages in the current message base for HARD 
DRIVE you would enter the following:

R;TS;HARD DRIVE

At this point, PCBoard would ask you what message you wished to begin the 
scan with.  If you enter L it will begin with the end of the message base and 
search backwards.  If you want to scan with the beginning message and search 
forward, you would enter 1+.

REPLY   Reply To A  Message

Subcommands

#               The message number (between 1 and 16,777,216) that you wish 
                to respond  to.  If you wish to reply to multiple messages  
                you may do so by entering a message number followed by a 
                comma, a space and then the next message number (e.g., 3252, 
                3523)

Description

A reply is nothing more than a new message.  There are a couple of things 
that make a reply different than entering a regular message.  These 
differences are listed below:

The message is automatically addressed so that your response is sent to the 
proper user.

The subject automatically defaults to the one of the previous message--you 
may change the subject if you wish

You may quote from the message you are responding to enhance the clarity of 
your response.

If security of the message that you are replying to is PUBLIC then you may 
change the security level of your reply. Otherwise, the message security of 
the original message will be carried through to the reply.  In other words 
you can respond to a PUBLIC message and make the reply a RECEIVER ONLY 
message. However, you cannot respond to a RECEIVER ONLY message and make the 
reply PUBLIC.

The message number of the original message displays in the header of your 
reply message as REFER #.

Aside from the differences listed, a reply is exactly like entering any 
other message.  Therefore, you will want to refer to the E command to find 
what options are available to you while entering your reply.

Quoting The Previous Message

Quoting the original message in your reply can enhance the clarity of your 
reply.  It makes it easier to understand the message and what you are 
responding to.  Very little effort is required for quoting a message.  The 
following paragraphs describe the various methods of quoting the previous 
message.

Remote:  From remote, there are two ways you can quote the original message.  
If you are in the full-screen editor then you can press CTRL-O to pull up the 
previous message or you may press ESC and then select Q from the message entry 
command prompt.

When the message is displayed, on your screen you will see line numbers to 
the left of each line.  When the message has been displayed you will be asked 
to enter the beginning line number you would like to quote, followed by the 
ending line number to quote.

Once you have entered the line numbers to quote, you will be returned to the 
message you are writing.  Where you left off you will now see the lines that 
you quoted.  To set the quote apart from your message, you will see a -> to 
the left of each line that is a quote.  When reading the message, these will 
show up in color to make it stand out even more.
                
Local:  When you are not calling in from remote and want to quote a message 
you may use PCBoard's scroll back buffer in addition to the methods that are 
described for remote users. Since your arrow keys are active in the full 
screen editor, you can access the scroll back buffer by pressing the o key on 
your keyboard.  When you are in the scroll back buffer, simply press the 
SPACE where you want to 
begin your quote and then cursor to the last part you 
want to quote and press the SPACE bar again.  The text that you have marked 
is now shown in reverse text.  If you want to use that text, press ESC to 
quote the marked text.  You may also remark the text you want to quote using 
the SPACE bar as previously mentioned.

Example

If you wanted to reply to the following message











you would type RE at the End of Message prompt.  RE is the subcommand to 
reply to the message that you are currently reading.



Depending on the conference configuration, the following information may be 
asked before you can enter a reply to a message:



Subject:  When entering a reply, you are given the ability to change the 
subject of the message if you wish.  If you simply press ENTER when prompted 
for the subject, the subject of the message you are replying to will be used.

Message Security:  If the message you are responding to is a public message, 
you are asked if you would like to change the security of the message in case 
you wish to respond privately rather than in a public message.

Echo Message:  If the Echo Mail in Conference option is turned on for the 
conference where the reply is entered, you are also asked if you would like 
to echo your response.

Route message to:  If your response is to be echoed and if the response is a 
private response, and if the Prompt for ROUTE info option is turned on, this 
question will be asked.  You can enter any routing information (such as a 
site address or personal address) in this field as appropriate for the 
NetMail system that the conference carries.

Request Return Receipt:  If the message is private, you are given the option 
to request a return receipt.  If you request a return receipt, you will 
receive a message notifying you when a user has read your message.

Use Full Screen Editor:  If you have setup your defaults to ask which editor 
each time you enter a message ( W user command ), you will be asked this 
question.



Once these questions have been asked, you are ready to enter the response.  
Usually, however, you will want to quote some of the text from the original 
message.  From within the full-screen editor, you can press CTRL-O to quote 
from the previous message. You will be shown the message you are responding 
to (with line numbers at the beginning of every line).  Once the original 
message has been displayed, you are asked which line you wish to begin your
quote from followed by the last line you wish to quote.







In this example, you could quote line one by specifying both the starting and 
ending line number as line 1.  You are then returned back to the editor and 
you will see that quoted text is now in your message with each line prefixed 
with -> so you can differentiate between your reply text and the quoted 
text.







If you are using the line editor instead of the full-screen editor, the 
method you use to quote will be a little different because that particular 
editor does not recognize CTRL-O.  Instead, you get to the message command 
prompt by pressing ENTER on a blank line in the editor.  At the command 
prompt, press Q followed by R.  You may then quote the message in the same 
manner that was used to quote from the full-screen editor.



If you are logged in locally, you can use the methods described previously to 
quote a message, or you can take advantage of PCBoard's scroll-back buffer 
(if you have it enabled).  You can mark any text in the scroll-back buffer 
and have it included in the message as quoted text.  To do so, simply hit the 
o key and you will be in scroll-back mode.  You will notice that you have a 
cursor that you can move around the screen.  Simply move the cursor to the 
beginning of the text you want to quote and press M.  Next, move the cursor 
to the last portion of the text you want to quote and press M.  All of the 
text between your beginning and ending mark is now highlighted.











Simply press E, and it will be entered in your reply as quoted text.  You may 
then continue to enter your reply and quote more text if you need to.











Once you have finished entering your response and quoting text, you can save 
your message just as you normally would if you were entering a message from 
scratch.

RM   Re-Read Memorized Message

This command allows you to read a message that you have previously memorized.  
If you try to execute this command and you have not memorized a message 
number, you will be notified that no message number has been memorized.  For 
more information on this command see the RM, RM+, and RM- subcommands for the 
R user command.

S   Script Questionnaires

Script questionnaires allow you to answer various questions that the SysOp 
has designed for you to answer.  These questions may cover a wide variety of 
topics and can vary in length.  When you execute this command you will be 
presented with a list of script questionnaires available in the current 
conference.  You simply select the number of the questionnaire you would like 
to answer and the questionnaire will be presented to you.  Answer each 
question in the space presented.

SELECT   Select Conferences for Scanning Or Reading

In order to determine what conferences you want to scan or read mail in, you 
must select the conference.  This command will enable you to select the 
conferences that you want to select.

Subcommands

[Conf. Num(s)]  Conference number(s) to select.  You may specify a single 
                conference or multiple conferences.  If you want to specify 
                multiple conferences, you must do so by specify a range 
                (e.g., 32-53) or by separating each conference by a space or 
                semicolon.  You can even combine ranges and individual 
                conferences.  See the example section of this command for 
                more details.

S               Select all conferences.  This subcommand selects all 
                conferences for scanning or reading.

D               De-select all conferences.  This subcommand de-selects all
                conferences for scanning or reading.

Using the SELECT Command Interactively

If you do not specify any subcommands when you run the SELECT command then 
you will be running it in interactive mode.  The only thing you need to 
remember about interactive mode is that it is slightly different than 
specifying everything when you use the command with subcommands.  The 
following lists the differences between the various subcommands when you are 
using the command in interactive mode.

[Conf. #]       Conference number(s) to select.  In interactive mode When you 
                select a conference you toggle its status.  If you select 
                conference 1 and it was already selected (had an X in the 
                FLAGS column), you will deselect that particular conference.  
                If you select a conference that was not already selected, you 
                will be asked what you wish to set your last message read 
                pointer to. You may set the last message read pointer to any 
                value that is within the range of messages in the conference.  
                To find the range of messages in the conference look to the 
                left of the conference name on the prompt where it is asking 
                you to enter your last message read.  You will see a range 
                of numbers that will look something like 3005-8292.  The 
                first number is the lowest message in the conference and the 
                second number is the highest.

                In addition, you can add a D to the right of the conference 
                number(s) to de-select the conference(s) that you specify.

    S           Select all conferences.  This subcommand selects all 
                conferences for scanning and all conferences will have an "X" 
                placed in its flags field.

    D           De-select all conferences.  This subcommand de-selects all 
                conferences for scanning and removes the "X" if there was one 
                in this conference's flags field.

    Q           Quit.  This subcommand quits the Select command.  Control is 
                returned to the main menu.

Description

Quite often, there will be conferences on a bulletin board that you do not 
want to participate in.  This command enables you to choose which conferences 
to automatically scan for messages both at login and when you use the A 
subcommand with a message read or scan command (e.g., the R, TS, and Q 
commands).  A two-column listing of conferences that you are able to join is 
displayed. In the list, PCBoard includes the conference number, description, 
last message read, highest message in the conference, and an "X" if you have 
marked this conference for scanning.  Only the conferences that you have 
access to will be listed.  If you find that a conference is not listed, it is 
because you do not have access to it.  The following is an example of the 
screen that is displayed to you:

                         Last  High 
Num  Conference          Read  Num.  Flags
-------------------------------------------
   1 Main Board          8548  7978  X
   2 SysOps Talk         1018  1001  X
   3 For Sale            6289  4301  X
   5 Programming         2106  1839
   6 Operating Systems   5119  4768  X
   7 Chit Chat           7831  7659  X
   8 BBS Ads             6711  6584
   9 Modem Info          2478  2178  X

Enter Conference Numbers, (S)elect All, (D)eselect All, or (Q)uit?

Examples

If you want to make sure that conferences 1 through 9 and conference number 
12 were selected, you could do this right from the command line by typing the 
following:

SELECT 1-9;12

Now, if you wanted to deselect just those conferences, you should do that by 
running the SELECT command interactively by typing SELECT on the command 
line.  At the next prompt, type 1-9;12 and you will see that the conferences 
will be deselcted.

T   Transfer Protocol

In order to transfer a file while connected to a bulletin board system you 
must use a file transfer protocol.  This command allows you to select your 
default file transfer protocol.

Subcommand

[protocol]      Protocol letter.  You can change your transfer protocol to 
                any valid transfer protocol letter.  If you do not specify a 
                protocol letter when you execute the command, you will be 
                given a list of available protocols from which you may 
                choose.  Valid protocol letters are A-Z and 0-9.

Description

When executed, a list is displayed that allows you to choose from among 
several different file transfer protocols for uploading or downloading files.  
Each is denoted by a single character, a letter or a number from 0 to 9.

When determining which protocol to select, it is important to remember that 
the same protocol must be used on the bulletin board system and by the 
communications program that you are using.  If you are unsure of which 
protocol to select or will be changing your selected protocol, select N for 
no default protocol.  If you select None, you will be asked each time you 
transfer a file which protocol you would like to use.

TEST   Test A Downloadable File

This command allows you to test a file for download before you actually 
download the file.  The testing procedure is determined by the SysOp so it 
may vary from system to system.

Subcommand

[filename]      Filename to test.  This is the file that will be tested 
                according to the testing procedures designated by the SysOp.  
                You may only specify one filename at a time.

Description

How many times have you downloaded a file only to find that it will not 
uncompress due to errors?  The TEST command permits you to check files for 
viruses and other corruptions that might exist in a particular file.  When 
you enter the filename to test, you will be informed after a short delay 
whether the file passed or failed the predetermined criteria.  If the 
filename you enter to test does not exist on the system, you will be notified 
that the filename you entered does not exist and you will be allowed to enter 
a new filename to test.

TS   Text Search Messages

Subcommands

[Text]          Text to search for.  This subcommand is required for use with 
                the TS command.  This is the text you wish to scan for in the 
                message base.  This may be a single word or it may be a 
                complex Boolean search string.

NOTE:  You may also specify any subcommands of the Read a Message command 
(R):

     Read: Selection Subcommands
     Read: Capture Subcommands

Description

Every once in a while you may have a need to search through all or a portion 
of messages on a particular system.  You might be experiencing a problem that 
you need help with or you may have a particular question in mind.  The TS 
command is very similar to the R command.  The major difference is that only 
the messages that contain the search text that you specify are displayed. 
Giving you the ability to scan messages and message headers to locate a 
specified text in a message makes it easier for you to display only those 
messages that interest you.  By using conditional text searches you can 
further limit the messages that are displayed to you.

U   Upload a File

Like the D user command, this allows you to transfer files between systems.  
In this case, however, you are sending a file to the bulletin board system 
instead of receiving one.

Subcommands

[file(s)]       Filename(s) to upload.  The parameter is given to identify 
                the uploaded file in the PCBoard system.  PCBoard will ask 
                for the filename or it may be included on the command line. 
                If more than one file is to be uploaded, each must be listed 
                on the command line.

[protocol]      Protocol to use for the upload.  If you wish to specify a 
                protocol that is different than your default protocol, 
                specify the protocol letter to use on the command line.

BYE             Logoff after transfer is complete.  After the file transfer 
                is complete, you may choose to disconnect automatically.  
                This option may be included on the command line with the 
                other options of this command.  Before you are disconnected 
                from the bulletin board system, you have 10 seconds to abort 
                and continue with your session.

Description

When you upload a file to a BBS you are adding a particular file to the file 
system so that other users can download the file. When you upload the file it 
could immediately be made available for download, or the SysOp may make all 
uploads private to review files before posting them for download.

When you begin an upload, you must specify the filename to upload and provide 
a description for the file before PCBoard will proceed with the transfer.  
After the filename and description has been provided, you will see the 
following:

Upload Drive :  341,188,608 Bytes Free Disk Space
Upload Status:  Posted Immediately
Protocol Type:  Ymodem/G BATCH
(Ctrl-X) Aborts Transfer

The first line shows you that there is over 331 megabytes of free space for 
your upload.  Obviously this would be plenty of space to handle just about 
any upload.  The second line tells you if the file will be Posted Immediately 
for download or Screened Before Posting.  The third line will display the 
protocol that you have selected for the transfer.  Only the protocol 
description is listed (not the protocol letter).  The final line just informs 
you that you may press CTRL-X to abort the transfer.

From the time you see these four lines you will have about 60 seconds to 
begin your transfer before PCBoard will automatically abort your transfer.

Local Uploads

If you have logged into PCBoard locally and you use an internal PCBoard 
protocol for an upload, PCBoard will do what is called a local upload.  When 
you do a local upload instead of trying to transfer the file via the normal 
methods, PCBoard will pop-up a box which asks you where it can find the 
file(s) you wish to upload.  Inside of the box you will see Local Upload Path 
or Filename?   In the box, enter the file(s) that you want to upload.  To 
specify more than one file you will need to enter a wildcard filename such as 
C:\TEMP\*.ZIP.

Example

If you want to upload a file called TMAL352.ARJ using Zmodem (which is 
protocol Z), you would type in the following:

U TMAIL352.ARJ Z

You will now be asked to enter a description of TMAL352.ARJ. You will be told 
how many lines of description you may enter and that you may begin the 
description with a / to make the file a private upload to the SysOp.  You 
must enter at least 5 characters for your description--PCBoard will reject 
any other description.

UB   Upload Batch

This command functions similarly to Upload A File with one minor exception.  
The UB command immediately assumes that more than one file will be uploaded.

Subcommands

[file(s)]       Filename(s) to upload.  If you wish, you may specify the 
                filename(s) that you wish to transfer on the command line. If 
                you specify more than one filename you need to separate each 
                filename with a space.

[protocol]      Protocol to use for the upload.  If you wish to specify a 
                protocol that is different than your default protocol, you 
                may do so on the command line.

BYE             Logoff after transfer is completed.  After the file transfer 
                is complete, you may indicate that you wish to disconnect.  
                This option may be included on the command line with the 
                other options of this command.  Before you are disconnected 
                from the bulletin board system you are given 10 seconds to 
                continue on with your current call.
                
Description

You will be prompted for each filename you wish to upload.  When you have 
finished entering all the files that you wish to upload press ENTER at the 
Filename to Upload prompt.  If you specify more than one filename to transfer 
then you will only be allowed to select batch file transfer protocols such as 
Ymodem Batch, Zmodem, or Ymodem/G.

Unannounced Uploads

When you finish an upload, PCBoard will check all of the files to make sure 
that there is a description for each file that has been uploaded.  Any file 
that does not have a description when the transfer is completed is called an 
unannounced upload.

If an unannounced upload is received, PCBoard will scan the uploaded file to 
see if it contains a FILE_ID.DIZ file.  If it does, it will send the file 
directly to the upload tester without asking you for a description of the 
file.  This capability is made available for ZIP, ARJ, LZH, PAK and ARC files 
as well as self-extracting versions of each.  It is built right into PCBoard.  
It is fast.  And it does not require outside (third party software) to do it.

At this point, you will be prompted to enter descriptions for any filename 
that does not yet have a file description.  Once all files have descriptions, 
PCBoard will begin testing the files (if you have that option enabled).

Before testing begins, you are given the option to hang up and let the 
testing proceed while you are off-line.  If you are calling long-distance 
this can save you a lot of time and money.

NOTE:  You will not be given the choice to hang up if you upload files while 
logged in locally.

USER   List Active Users

This command allows you to search the user file for a text string.  PCBoard 
will display the user's name, location, and the last date the user logged 
into the system for each matching record.

Subcommand

[text]          Text to search for.  You may specify any text to search for.  
                PCBoard analyzes this input, scans the USERS file, and 
                displays the name, city/location, and last date on for all 
                matching records.  The search string you enter could be part 
                of a first or last name, or even part of a city name.  This 
                search string may also be Boolean if you need to restrict 
                your search further.

Description

This command allows you to search the user file for a text string.  You are 
responsible for inputting the text string. PCBoard provides a list of users 
with the text string found somewhere in their records.  In the list are the 
user's name, location, and the last date the user logged into the system.

NOTE:  PCBoard does not display any sensitive or confidential information 
with this command.  Only the name and location (City and State) of each user 
found will be displayed.  In addition, only fields which do not contain 
confidential information will be searched in the users record (e.g., the 
password field is not searched).

Example
 
If you wanted to find everyone from Evergreen, Nevada, you may want to search 
all user records for the word evergreen.  If this was the case, you would 
enter the following at the command line.

USER EVERGREEN

At this point you will may see the following on your screen:

       User Name                  Location              Last On
------------------------  ------------------------  ---------------
MARK HAMPTON              EVERGREEN, NEVADA         10-09-93 03:47
CYRUS NEILSON             EVERGREEN, NV             04-23-94 21:12
MAX SANCHEZ               EVERGREEN,NV              12-13-93 14:21
GERALD CARPENTER          EVERGREEN,NEVADA          05-13-91 14:04
ALLEN ROBERTS             EVERGREEN, AZ             06-11-93 03:31

V   View Settings

This command displays the current settings of your user record.

Description

This command allows you to view various information and stats regarding your 
current call.  The display may look like the following:

Caller Num.: 1,005,213
Lst Date On: 02-08-93
Expire Date: None
# Times On : 6,008
Page Length: 23
Expert Mode: On
Security Lv: 120
# Downloads: 684
# Uploads  : 256
Bytes Avail: Unlimited
Byte Ratio : 7.3:1
File Ratio : 10.2:1
L/Msg. Read: 117,261
High Msg. #: 117,261
Active Msgs: 1,936
Tr/Protocol: No default protocol -- ask each time.


The following describes each field that you may see on the
status screen:

Caller Num:  This is the number of calls that the bulletin board system you 
are calling has answered since operation of the system began.

Lst Date On:  The last date you called the system is stored in this field.

Expire Date:  This field contains the date at which your account will expire.  
If you have no expiration date then this field will contain the word None.  
Some bulletin board systems set their users to expire at a certain date.  
When you are "expired" your security level is usually dropped until you 
follow the instructions that are displayed to you.

# Times On:  This value shows how many times you have called this system.

Page Length:  The page length setting allows you to configure how many lines 
will be displayed on your screen before you want PCBoard to issue a More? 
prompt and ask you if you are ready for the next screen.  This value may be 
changed by using the P user command.

Expert Mode:  If expert mode is turned on, an On is displayed. Otherwise, you 
are in novice mode and an Off is displayed.  You may toggle expert mode by 
using the X user command.

Security Lv:  This value is the security level that you have been assigned on 
this system.  The bulletin board system uses this value to control what you 
can and cannot do on the  system.

# Downloads:  This is the total number of files you have downloaded from the 
system.

# Uploads:  This is the total number of files you have uploaded to the 
system.

Bytes Avail:  This field shows you how many bytes you can download for the 
remainder of the day.  If this value is set to Unlimited then you may 
download as much as your time allows.

Byte Ratio:  Shows the total number of bytes that have been downloaded for
each byte uploaded.  The number to the left of the colon shows the number of
bytes downloaded for each byte shown to the right of the colon.

File Ratio:  Shows the total number of files that have been downloaded for
each file uploaded.  The number to the left of the colon shows the number of
files downloaded for each file shown to the right of the colon.

L/Msg. Read:  This field contains the last message number you have read in 
the current conference.  As you change conferences this value will be 
updated.

High Msg. #:  This value is the highest message number in the conference you 
are currently in.

Active Msgs:  This value is the number of messages that are active in the 
conference you are currently in.  While you will see that each conference has 
a range of messages (e.g. 332-982) some of the messages in that range may 
have been deleted. Therefore, you cannot subtract the low message number from 
the high message number to get the actual number of active messages.

Tr/Protocol:  This is the name of the protocol you have selected as your 
default transfer protocol.  If None is displayed, you will be prompted for a 
transfer protocol to use each time you start a file transfer.

If you happen to be logging in as the SysOp (as record #1 in the USERS file) 
then two additional lines will be displayed to you:

Defined #'s:  When you setup a conference, you are asked how many message 
blocks you want for the particular conference.  If you enter 4 in that field, 
then you will be allowed to have a range of 4096 active messages in the 
conference.  This field will list the number of active messages that can be 
in the current conference.  This number is obtained by taking the message 
blocks as defined in the conference and multiplying it by 1024.

Free Msg #s:  Displays the number of messages that you may add to the current 
conference before exceeding the number of message blocks that you have 
defined.  For example, if your low message number is 4362, your high message 
number is 8257, and you have defined the conference for 6 message blocks 
(6144 messages) then you will have 2248 free messages before you exceed your 
defined range of active messages.

WHO  Other Users Online

This command enables you to see who is currently online.  Each user name is 
displayed including the city/location and a brief synopsis of what the user 
is currently doing online.

Description

Most users on multi-node systems like to know who else is currently on the 
system.  To satisfy this curiosity you can use the WHO command.  When 
executed, PCBoard displays the status of each node on a multi-node system.  
You can use this command to see if anyone is online that you would like to 
chat with, who is doing what on the system, etc.  This command is only 
available on multi-node systems.  If you try to execute it on a single node 
system you will get a Sorry, no Network is Active message.

Example

(#)   Status                  User
---   ---------------------   -----------------------------
  1   Out of Code in DOOR     JIM HALBROM - MAIL
  2   Available for CHAT      NEIL GRANGER (SANDY CREEK, MN)
  3   Transferring a File     BILL MOWERY (CHERBOURG, TX)
  4   Available for CHAT      TAMARA ANTHONY (ASHWOOD, NJ)
  5   No Caller this Node

From the above example display we can see that the user on node 1 is 
currently running a door called MAIL.  The users on node 2 and 4 are logged 
in and probably reading messages or scanning for files.  The user on node 3 
is transferring a file.  Nobody is currently on node 5 because it is waiting 
for a call.

W   Write User Information

This command allows you to change various information about your
account such as your password.

Description

This command allows you to change your own user information. Based on how the 
Disable Full Record Updating option was answered in PCBSetup, certain 
questions may not be updated via this command.  The following lists each 
question which will be asked depending on how you answered the Disable Full 
Record Updating option in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control.

Disable Full Record Updating : N


 Password (one word please)?
City and State calling from?
Business or data phone # is?
   Home or voice phone # is?
Brand of CPU?
Clear the screen between each message?
Scroll multi-screen messages?
Use long headers when reading messages?
Full Screen Editor Default: (Y)es, (N)o, (A)sk?
Set editor workspace default to 79 columns?
       Select Conference(s)?


Disable Full Record Updating : Y

 Password (one word please)?
Clear the screen between each message?
Scroll multi-screen messages?
Use long headers when reading messages?
Full Screen Editor Default: (Y)es, (N)o, (A)sk?
Set editor workspace default to 79 columns?
       Select Conference(s)?

X   Toggle Expert Mode

This command enables you to toggle expert mode on the system. Using 
subcommands you may also explicitly specify if you want expert mode or not.

Subcommands

ON              Explicitly select expert mode.  

OFF             Explicitly select non-expert or novice mode.  

Description

When this command is used with no subcommands it acts as a toggle between 
expert and novice modes.  If expert mode is turned on, menus are not shown.  
In novice mode, if there is a menu, it will be displayed after each command 
is executed.

Examples

If you simply want to toggle expert mode then you would press X at any 
conference command prompt.

If you wanted to explicitly select either expert or novice mode then you 
would need to use one of the subcommands.  For example, if you want to make 
sure that you are in export mode, then you would enter X OFF at any 
conference command prompt.

Y   Your Personal Mail

This command permits you to scan for mail addressed to you to determine if 
you have sent or received messages.

Subcommands

+               Scan forward.  When added to a message number (e.g., 300+),
                PCBoard scans from that message forward.

-               Scan reverse.  When added to a message number(e.g., 300-),
                PCBoard scans from that message backward.
 
A		Scan all selected conferences.  PCBoard scans all selected
                conferences for messages from or to you.

ALL             Scan all conferences.  PCBoard scans all conferences for
                messages from or to you.

C		Scan current conference.  Only the current message base is
                scanned for messages.

L               Scan in long report mode.  This option shows messages in long 
                list mode.  The message bases are scanned and the 
                corresponding number of each message found is displayed.

NS              Display in non-stop mode.  Screen displays are placed in 
                non-stop mode (without more? prompts).

Q               Scan in quick report mode.  Messages are shown in quick list 
                mode.  The message bases are scanned, but only the number of 
                messages and the number of messages to you are displayed and 
                not what those message numbers are.

S               Scan unread mail.  The message base is scanned from the last 
                message read.  Only messages after this point are displayed.

Description

This command allows you to display the number of messages that are addressed 
to or from you.  You can use the subcommands to help select the conferences 
that will be scanned and if you want to start from the beginning of the 
message base or only messages you have not read. The report format you choose 
determines if PCBoard only counts the number of messages or if it will 
actually show the message numbers.

The Difference Between Short And Long Reports

The Y command can report in short or long form.  When you select short form, 
your display will resemble the following:

                     Messages  Messages
Num    Conference     To You    Found
------ ------------- --------- ---------
   0  Main Board            0         6
   1  Hardware              0        14
   6  Software              0         5
   9  Chit_Chat             2         6

This display tells you that there are a total of 25 messages that you have 
not read yet in the Main Board, Hardware and Software conferences.  In the 
Chit_Chat conference, there are 6 new messages, 2 of which are addressed to 
you.

In long form, the same scan would look like the following:

Scanning Main Board
  Msgs For You: None
 Msgs From You: None
  # Msgs Found: 6

Scanning Hardware (1) Conference
  Msgs For You: None
 Msgs From You: None
  # Msgs Found: 14

Scanning Software (6) Conference
  Msgs For You: None
 Msgs From You: None
  # Msgs Found: 5

Scanning Chit_Chat (9) Conference
  Msgs For You: 10472  10475
 Msgs From You: 10474+
  # Msgs Found: 6

As you can see, the long mode displays not only messages to you, but also 
from you.  In addition, it lists the message numbers and to the right of each 
message number it displays the message status code if appropriate.  For a 
list of message status codes, see the Q user command.

The default scan mode is determined by the Default to (Q)uick on Personal 
Mail Scan setting in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Messages.  If you 
answer Y to this question then PCBoard will default to quick display mode.  
Otherwise, long display mode will be the default.

Examples

If you want to count the new mail in the conferences that you have selected 
for scanning, enter the following command:

Y;Q;S;A

Z   Zippy Directory Scan

This command enables you to search through the file descriptions in various 
file directories for the text that you specify.

Subcommands

[directory #]   Directory number to search.  PCBoard scans for the indicated 
                text in this directory.  When using the Zippy Directory Scan 
                command, you must specify a directory or range of directories 
                that PCBoard should search for the file specification.  You 
                may list a single directory, a range of directories in the 
                format #-# or a list of directories in a #;#;# format.  There 
                are two letters that you may use as a directory number.  If 
                you use A for the directory number, it tells PCBoard  to 
                search all file directories in the current conference.  
                Likewise, if you use U for the directory number, the upload 
                directory of the current conference will be searched.

[search text]   Text to search for.  This is the text you wish to search for 
                in the directory listings.  If you wish to search for an 
                imbedded space (e.g., "TEST "), you will need to imbed that 
                part of the string in quotes as shown above.  Since you 
                cannot enter quote characters on the command line you would 
                not be able to enter the above example on the command line.  
                This search string may also make use of Boolean operands if 
                you wish to further qualify your search.

                NOTE:  The search is not case-sensitive.  This means that if 
                you search for the word TEXT then it is the same as if you 
                had searched for word Text.  In other words, capitalization 
                of your search text does not matter.

D               Each file found with the specified text is flagged for 
                download.  The system does not immediately download the 
                files, but waits until the D or DB user commands.

N               This subcommand enables you to include the minimum file date 
                from which the scan should search for.  This is identical to 
                the N user command but you can use it in conjunction with a 
                zippy scan to help restrict the file descriptions that you 
                search.

NS              Screen output is displayed in non-stop or continuous mode.

Description

This command scans the file directories to find a specified text string.  If 
you do not specify the text to search for on the command line, you will be 
prompted to enter the text you wish to search for.  Possibly one of PCBoard's 
most powerful time-saving features, the Zippy directory scan command will 
locate text in both the file name field and the descriptions. Like other 
PCBoard searching features, the zippy directory scan command utilizes Boolean 
operands (AND, OR, and NOT).

How To Make Your Search More Specific

Quite often you may notice that your search found too many matches.  Rather 
than wading through all of the matches to find what you were really after, 
let PCBoard help you make your search more specific so that you can save some 
additional time.

Perhaps the easiest way to restrict your search is to use Boolean operands.  
As an example, let's say that you scanned all file directories in the current 
conference for the word DISK. After a couple of screenfulls, you realized 
that you did not make your search specific.  At this point, you realize what 
you are really after is a utility which will format a floppy disk. You could 
enter "Format a disk" in the text to search for. However, you are pretty sure 
that all of the descriptions of the utilities that format disks would not 
contain "Format a disk" in the description.

What you would need to use in this example is the Boolean AND operator.  In 
the text to search for, tell PCBoard that you want to search for DISK & 
FORMAT.  The & character signifies to PCBoard that you want to search for 
both words in the description but you do not care if they are right next to 
each other in the description.  Instead, you just want them to be anywhere in 
the file description.

If you searched for DISK & FORMAT and it still turned up too many matches, 
you may need to restrict your search even further. You notice that some of 
the matches were dated back in 1989 and may not be compatible with your 
current system.  Therefore, you want to display only utilities that are dated 
01-01-90 or older. What you could do, is use the N subcommand as described 
above. You would type the following for this final search:

Z N 010190 DISK & FORMAT A

You will notice that this tells PCBoard to zippy scan all file directories 
but only display those files that are newer than 01-01-90 and that have the 
words DISK and FORMAT in the description.

How To Make Your Searches Less Specific

Sometimes you may want to make your searches less specific.  You may be 
wondering why you want to make your searches less specific.  Perhaps the best 
way to illustrate this is with an example.

If you were searching for all hard drive utilities you may enter HARD DRIVE 
as your search text.  However, some people may call them hard disks instead 
of hard drives.  You are now faced with a small dilemma.  You either have to 
run two searches, or you have to find a way to search for either HARD DRIVE 
or HARD DISK. To specify that you want to search for either phrase you use 
the Boolean OR operator.  You use the | character to denote the Boolean OR 
operator.  If you will recall, we were going to search for HARD DRIVE or HARD 
DISK.  If you simply replace the word or with the | character that will make 
the search string correct.  

Now, when you search, you will be searching for HARD DRIVE or HARD DISK 
anywhere in the description.  You could get fancy with Boolean operators and 
consolidate this just a little more by searching for HARD & (DRIVE | DISK).  
Since you are going to be looking for HARD DRIVE or HARD DISK, you can just 
say search for the word HARD and either the word DISK or DRIVE.

Examples

Perhaps the simplest example would be to search for a single word in all file 
directories in the current conference.  If you wanted to search for the word 
VGA then you would enter the following at the conference command prompt.

Z VGA A

Obviously, this would probably turn up quite a few matches, so
you may want to define your search better.  If you were only interested in 
games that supported VGA then you may want to modify so that you search for 
the words VGA and GAME.  You would enter the following at the conference 
command prompt:

Z VGA & GAME A

Since you are searching for the words VGA and GAME, it does not matter what 
order you put the words in.  For example, you would perform the exact same 
search if you typed the following:

Z GAME & VGA A

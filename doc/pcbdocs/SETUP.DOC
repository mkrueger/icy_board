PCBSetup is a utility designed to configure the operation of PCBoard.  
With PCBSetup you can define new conferences, add more file directories, 
and even change configuration options which determines how your system 
operates.

There are three ways to access PCBSetup:


From the call waiting screen, select PCBSetup.

While logged in locally (not with the /LOCALON switch for PCBoard), you can 
press ALT-S and select PCBoard Configuration (PCBSETUP).

From the DOS prompt you can load PCBSETUP.EXE.  If a PCBOARD.DAT file cannot 
be found in the current directory and you have not used the /FILE command 
line parameter, you will receive an error message stating that PCBOARD.DAT 
could not be found.

If you need to specify a different location for your PCBOARD.DAT file, use 
PCBSETUP /FILE:[location of PCBOARD.DAT].  For example, to load PCBSetup and 
tell it to use the data file located in C:\TEMP\, you would type:


   PCBSETUP /FILE:C:\TEMP\PCBOARD.DAT


Once PCBSetup is running, you will see the Main Menu (shown on the previous 
page).  The various functions of PCBSetup are available from these menu 
options.  To select a particular option you can press the letter at the 
beginning of the line, or you may move the currently highlighted option using 
the cursor keys and press R.  If you make a mistake, press E to return to the 
previous menu.  To get help with a particular screen or option, press F1 to 
access the online help.

Command Line Parameters

PCBSetup has two command line parameters that you can use when executing 
PCBFiler to determine how it should behave.  To use a command line switch you 
must execute PCBSetup from the DOS command prompt and you need to specify the 
command line parameter after you enter PCBSETUP at the command prompt as 
shown in the following example:


PCBSETUP /CNAMES


If you need to enter more than one command line parameter, separate each 
parameter with a space.


PCBSETUP /FILE:H:\TEMP\PCBOARD.DAT /CNAMES


/CNAMES

Previous versions of PCBoard wrote conference information to a text file 
called CNAMES while the current version of PCBoard writes this information to 
CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD.  These two files are binary data and consequently 
are not as easy to edit manually as the older CNAMES file.  When this command 
line switch is used, PCBSetup will reread the CNAMES file instead of using 
the information stored in CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD.

There are advantages and disadvantages to using this switch. First, the 
advantages:


Files that are in text file format are easier to edit with a wide range of 
editors.

If you are adding a lot of conferences, you can easily pattern the new 
conferences after an existing conferences by cutting and pasting text.

The following are the disadvantages to using this switch:

The CNAMES is not updated by PCBSetup unless you do a full save when exiting.  
If a quick save is used, the CNAMES file will not be updated. If you are not 
careful, you could use a CNAMES file that is not up-to-date and consequently 
alter your system configuration in an undesirable manner.

The CNAMES file does not contain all of the information that the combination 
of CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD does.  In fact, nearly all of the fields listed 
in the second conference setup screen are not stored in the CNAMES file.  
This means that if you have PCBSetup re-read the CNAMES file, the default 
values will be used for all fields that are not written to the CNAMES file.

This command line switch is not designed for use by novice SysOps.  If you do 
not have a good knowledge of text file editing, you can really foul up your 
system configuration by using this switch.

If you use this command line switch, begin by making backups of your 
CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD files.  Next, load PCBSetup without the /CNAMES 
switch and then immediately exit answering Y when asked if you want to save 
configuration files.  This will insure that the CNAMES file is up-to-date.  
Once you have done these steps, you may proceed to make the changes you need 
to make to the CNAMES file.

/FILE:[filename]

Normally, PCBSetup requires that a PCBOARD.DAT file exists in the 
subdirectory where you load it.  If you want to use a PCBOARD.DAT in a 
location other than the current subdirectory, use this command line switch.

To use the /FILE parameter, you need to specify the location of the 
PCBOARD.DAT after you enter /FILE:.  For example, if you want to use a 
PCBOARD.DAT that is stored in C:\PCB\NODE1\, enter the following to have 
PCBSetup use that DAT file:

PCBSETUP /FILE:C:\PCB\NODE1\PCBOARD.DAT


Exiting And Checking Your Configuration

To exit PCBSetup you need to press E at the Main Menu.  When you do, you will 
be asked if you wish to save your configuration. The following describes each 
option available to you:



        N       Do not save any changes you have made to your PCBOARD.DAT 
                file and exit.  Any changes you have made to the fields in 
                your conference configuration are automatically saved 
                whenever you exit the conference screen.

        Q       Save all changes to your configuration without checking the 
                validity of the paths and drives in your configuration.  This 
                will probably be the selection you will use most, because it 
                is quicker then checking your entire configuration each time 
                you exit PCBSetup.

        Y       Saves all changes to your configuration and checks all paths 
                and drives to make sure they exist.  In addition, your CNAMES 
                file will be updated for those utilities that use CNAMES 
                instead of CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD for conference 
                information.  If you have any conferences that do not have 
                message bases, the message bases will be initialized for you.

The following section describes in more detail what will occur when you 
select either Y (full save) or Q (quick save) when asked if you wish to save 
your changes.

Full Save

PCBoard divides the checking of your system into four sections. At any 
section you can press E to skip over any of the following sections:

Checking Directories While Saving Files

At this junction, PCBoard is going to check the drives and paths in your 
configuration to make sure they are all valid.  All filenames and paths 
listed in all setup screens will be checked to make sure they exist 
(including conference information)

If a path does not exist, you will be shown the path that does not exist, and 
then asked if you wish to create it.  If a drive does not exist, you will be 
shown which invalid drive you had in your configuration.

If the invalid path is in one of your conferences, you will be told what 
conference and what question has the invalid path. With this in mind, you can 
quickly and easily fix your configuration to point to a proper path if you 
need to.

Checking BLT.LST file(s)

When you see this on your screen, PCBSetup is checking the bulletins defined 
in each conference's BLT.LST file.  Only the paths to each bulletin are 
checked for validity.  If the actual bulletin does not exist, nothing is 
printed to the screen by PCBSetup.

To help speed things up, PCBSetup is smart enough to know when it has checked 
a BLT.LST before and will skip it.  This will save you an immense amount of 
time especially if you have numerous conferences using the same BLT.LST file.

Checking DIR.LST file(s)

When you see this on your screen, PCBSetup is checking the file directories 
defined in each conference's DIR.LST file.  Only the paths to each DIR 
(description) file and attached subdirectory are checked for validity.  If 
the DIR file does not exist, nothing is printed to the screen by PCBSetup.

To help speed things up, PCBSetup is smart enough to know when it has checked 
a DIR.LST before and will skip it.  This will save you an immense amount of 
time especially if you have numerous conferences using the same DIR.LST file.

Checking SCRIPT.LST file(s)

When you see this on your screen, PCBSetup is checking the scripts defined in 
each conference's SCRIPT.LST file.  Only the paths to each script are checked 
for validity.  If the actual script file does not exist, nothing is printed 
to the screen by PCBSetup.

To help speed things up, PCBSetup is smart enough to know when it has checked 
a SCRIPT.LST before and will skip it.  This will save you an immense amount 
of time especially if you have numerous conferences using the same SCRIPT.LST 
file.

Checking DLPATH.LST file(s)

When you see this on your screen, PCBSetup is checking each path listed to 
insure that they are valid paths on your system.  If you have specified an 
index file in your DLPATH.LST file, it will only check to insure that the 
path that points to your index file is valid.

To help speed things up, PCBSetup is smart enough to know when it has checked 
a DLPATH.LST before and will skip it.  This will save you an immense amount 
of time especially if you have numerous conferences using the same DLPATH.LST 
file.

Quick Save

A quick save is by far the quickest way to save your configuration.  When you 
choose to save your configuration in quick mode, your configuration is not 
checked to make sure that all paths are valid.  Instead, it simply copies the 
values that were in memory at the time you exited the program and writes them 
out to memory.

The PCBOARD.DAT File

The PCBOARD.DAT file is the main configuration file for PCBoard. In fact, all 
fields in menu options A-H from the Main Menu are stored inside of this file.  
If you are running multiple nodes, you probably have a PCBOARD.DAT file for 
each node.

If each node has a separate configuration file, you may change the way the 
node operates dramatically.  For example, you could change one node to point 
to a different PWRD file.  This would allow you to limit access to this node 
without effecting the other nodes on your system.

The disadvantage of having separate PCBOARD.DAT files for each node is quite 
evident when you have a lot of nodes.  If you have 20 nodes operating and 
each has a separate configuration file, you could spend a lot of time 
updating all 20 nodes to change the location of a file.

You are not forced to use a PCBOARD.DAT for each node.  With the ability for 
PCBOARD.EXE and all of the supporting utilities (PCBFiler, PCBSetup, etc.) to 
utilize the /FILE command line parameter, you can share data files between 
nodes.  If you choose to share data files between nodes, remember that node 
specific information such as node number, serial port to use, and other items 
are all stored in the PCBOARD.DAT file. Therefore, you may want to take 
advantage of the command line and environment parameters of PCBOARD.EXE to 
over-ride information that is stored in the configuration file.

Specifying File & Paths

Throughout PCBSetup, you will be specifying where PCBoard should find 
filenames and what paths should be used to store files. Because of this, you 
should have a good knowledge of subdirectories and how they are used by DOS.  
If you do not, you will most likely have a hard time configuring your PCBoard 
system to operate the way that you want it to operate.

There are two ways that you can specify a path or filename -- absolute and 
relative.  The following sections describe the difference between absolute 
and relative naming.

Absolute Naming Conventions

You are probably most familiar with this method of specifying a filename.  
For example, if you tell someone to view C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT, you have given them 
an absolute filename.  In other words, you told them the drive, the 
subdirectory (in this case the root directory), and the filename.  If they 
view that file they are guaranteed to view one and only one file because you 
told them exactly where the file is.

To relate this to your PCBoard configuration, you would want to specify 
absolute filenames when configuring the locations of files that should be 
shared by all nodes (e.g., user file). That way, you can be assured that the 
proper filename will be accessed by all nodes.

Relative Naming Conventions

Specifying a filename in a relative fashion is, for some, a more difficult 
concept to understand.  Relative addressing will take into account the 
current drive and directory rather than having that information provided via 
absolute addressing.  For example, if you know the file is in the current 
directory then you could simply reference the filename.  You would not need 
to specify the drive, path, and filename as it would be a waste of time.

Another example would be if you wanted to see a directory of all files in 
your C:\PCB\GEN\ subdirectory while you are sitting at the C:\PCB> DOS 
prompt.  You could type

DIR C:\PCB\GEN

but it would be even faster to type

DIR GEN

The reason that you can get away with this is because you are already in the 
C:\PCB\ subdirectory.  Why type it in again? Remember that relative 
addressing takes the current directory into account and adds the relative 
information to the end of the filename.  When you typed DIR GEN you forced 
DOS to look for a GEN subdirectory underneath the current subdirectory.  If 
you were to change to your DOS subdirectory and then type DIR GEN you would 
receive an error message that no files were found because you do not have a 
C:\DOS\GEN subdirectory, but you do have a C:\PCB\GEN subdirectory.

At this point, you have to be asking yourself what good will this relative 
filename information do for my PCBoard configuration?  The answer to that 
question is "quite a bit" if you are running multiple nodes.

Most likely all of your nodes will point to the same CNAMES file.  Inside of 
the CNAMES file more filenames are specified that relate to each conference 
on your system.  For example, the location of the NEWS file for each 
conference is located in the CNAMES file.  If you wanted every node to have 
an individual NEWS file then you could change the location of the file to 
point to NEWS instead of something like C:\PCB\GEN\NEWS  Because no path or 
drive information is specified, PCBoard is going to look in the default 
directory for a file called NEWS.  If that file is found, it will be 
displayed.  What really makes all of this work is the fact that no two nodes 
will use the same default subdirectory.  Therefore, you can have node 
specific NEWS files by using relative addressing.

SysOp Information

This menu option will allow you to define information about the sysop.  You 
can specify if you wish to let users see your real name among other settings.  
If you are looking to control the security level of  SysOp related functions 
then you should select the Security Levels option from the Main Menu instead. 
The following describes each field on the Sysop Information screen:

Sysop's Name (when NOT using Real Name)

In this field, enter the first name of the SysOp.  Enter a name in this field 
only if you do not wish to use your real name as defined in record #1 of the 
users file.  This field is used in some of the following areas:

When entering chat mode with a user.  The user will receive a message that 
says "Hello, this is..."

When using F5 to shell to DOS the user is informed who has dropped to DOS.

When you are logged in, this will be used for your first name or any time the 
@FIRST@ macro is used.

NOTE:  This field is not recognized if you have answered Y to the Use Real 
Name (Yes=Use name found in USERS file) option.

Local Password (used at the Call Waiting screen)

The local password gives you the ability to password protect the following 
buttons on the call-waiting screen.

Sysop - Busy
Sysop - Not Busy
PCBSysMgr
PCBFiler
PCBSetup

and optionally (if you have answered Y to Require Local Password to Exit 
PCBoard)

DOS - Busy
DOS - Not Busy

If you leave the local password field blank, no password will be asked.  If 
you do enter a password, enter the proper password to access the restricted 
buttons on the call waiting screen. Entering an invalid password will recycle 
the modem and return you to the call waiting screen.

Require Local Password to Exit PCBoard

If you want to protect people from dropping to DOS from the call-waiting 
screen you can enable this option.  One thing you need to keep in mind that 
is that if someone has access to the keyboard they also have access to reboot 
the computer and optionally abort the AUTOEXEC.BAT to access DOS.

Enabling this option is not a fool-proof way to protect others from accessing 
DOS on the machine, but it will make it more difficult and maybe discourage 
an unauthorized person from accessing DOS.

        N       Do not ask for the local password when attempting to exit to 
                DOS.

        Y       Ask for the local password when exiting PCBoard.
        
Use Real Name (Yes=Use name found in USERS file)

This option gives you the ability to determine how PCBoard refers to the 
SysOp defined in record number 1 of the user file. The user defined in this 
count can use their real name or the name SYSOP depending on how this 
question is asked.  Valid options for this field are:


        N       Any messages that you leave will be shown as having been left 
                by SYSOP regardless of the name in record #1 of the user 
                file. In addition, the Sysop Name field on this screen will 
                now become active.
  
                Disabling this function has an additional benefit.  A user 
                cannot login to the system using the name SYSOP.  Hence, the 
                user name in record #1 must be known to access that 
                particular account.  If you decide not to use the name 
                located in the user file, your users will not know the name 
                of that account. Not only would a user that is attempting to 
                hack your account have to get your password right, they would 
                also have to guess your name as well.

        Y       The user name that is found in record #1 of the user file 
                will be used for the operation of the bulletin board.  When 
                you leave a message, the user name in record #1 will be 
                stored in the FROM: field, etc.

Use Graphics When Logged On Locally

When you access the bulletin board by using the Sysop - Busy or Sysop - Not 
Busy buttons on the call-waiting screen then PCBoard will skip the question 
that asks which type of graphics you wish to use, your name, password, etc.

This option will let you choose if you wish to default to color graphics mode 
when logging in using the previously mentioned buttons on the call-waiting 
screen.  Valid options are:

        N       Do not use graphics mode when logging in as the SysOp.  You 
                may want to choose this setting if you are using a monochrome 
                monitor on your system.

        Y       Assume graphics mode when logging in as the SysOp.


File Locations

When you select this menu option, you will be presented with an additional 
menu that separates the file locations into categories.  Select the category 
of file locations that you wish to modify.

System Files & Directories

From this screen, you can edit the file locations of the most commonly 
accessed files (often referred to as system files).  In each of these fields 
on this screen, enter the file and/or location where a particular 
configuration file will be found. Each field and how it relates to your 
system configuration is explained in the following sections:

Name/Loc of Conference Data

PCBoard stores the conference information (including the Main Board) in what 
is referred to as the conference data file.  Any fields in the conference 
configuration screens (Main Board Configuration and Conference Configuration 
is considered to be conference data.

The default filename is CNAMES, but  a CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD file are 
also created in the same location as the CNAMES file.

The CNAMES file is a simple text file that contains most, but not all, of the 
conference configuration information.  This file is used by a lot of 
third-party programs who wish to access configuration information about a 
particular conference.  The CNAMES file is only updated when you exit 
PCBSetup and answer Y to the Save configuration files question.

CNAMES.@@@ and CNAMES.ADD are the primary files that are used to store 
conference information.  These files are random access to increase the speed 
that information can be looked up for conference information.  These two 
files are updated automatically by PCBSetup. 


Location for multiple nodes

If you are running all of your nodes from a single machine using a 
multitasker, then you may store this file in any location, but you should 
make sure that all nodes point to the same location.

On a network, you will want to store the CNAMES file on a server so that all 
nodes may access it.

It is perfectly valid for each node to point to its own CNAMES file, but if 
you use this type of configuration you will have to update each and every 
node's CNAMES file whenever you make a change the configuration for a 
conference.


Name/Loc of User File

The user file stores the majority of information about each caller on your 
system.  For example, the actual user name, password, and city data is just a 
small sample of the data that is stored in the user file.


Location for multiple nodes

If you are running all of your nodes from a single machine using a 
multitasker, then you may store this file in any location, but you need to 
make sure that all nodes point to the same location.

On a network, you will want to store the user file on a server so that all 
nodes may access it.  Make sure that all nodes access the same user file.


Name/Loc of User Info File

The user info file contains additional information about each user.  This is 
the file where any TPA or PSA information will be stored about each caller.  
Basically, you can look at this file as an extension of the user file.


Location for multiple nodes

Since this file is an extension of the user file, you should treat it in the 
same manner.  This means that it should be stored in a single shared location 
where all nodes can access it.


Name/Loc of Caller Log

The caller logs record information about each session on your system.  From 
viewing the caller logs you can determine when a particular user successfully 
logged in, the major functions that they performed while online (entering 
messages, transferring files, joining a conference, etc.)  

If you are running more than one node, the node number will be added to the 
end of the filename you specify for the caller log. Therefore, if you were 
running three nodes and you specified C:\PCB\MAIN\CALLER for all nodes then 
you would find a CALLER1, CALLER2, and CALLER3 file in that subdirectory:

If you are running the /100 node version or higher, you should change the 
name of your caller logs to something like CLR instead of the default 
(CALLER).  The reason you should do this is because CALLER100 would not be a 
valid DOS filename.  

The following is a sample log entry (when viewing online):

**************************************************************

Location for multiple nodes

When running multiple nodes, you should store your caller log files in a 
common location for all nodes to access.  If you are multitasking multiple 
nodes on a single machine, this means that you specify the same location for 
all nodes.  For a multiple node installation on a network, all caller logs 
should be stored in one common location on the server with each node pointing 
to the same location.

If all nodes do not write their caller logs to the same location, SysOp 
command  13 will not function properly because it will not be able to access  
all files.


Name/Loc of Group CHAT File

When callers use the CHAT command to communicate with one another, PCBoard 
uses the Group CHAT file to handle the communications between the various 
nodes and chat channels.  

This file will be a fixed size with the actual file size being determined by 
the total number of nodes your package supports. For example, the group CHAT 
file for a 250 node version of PCBoard would be larger than the group CHAT 
file for a 10 node version.


Location for multiple nodes

Like the user file, your group CHAT file must be stored in the same physical 
location on disk for group chat to function properly.


Location of Group CHAT .CAP files

If you have enabled the option in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | 
Configuration Switches which deals with capturing the group chat session to 
disk, this field will specify where the capture files will be.  The contents 
of the capture files include date and time stamps, the node number of the 
caller, the caller's name, and the text of the complete line of information 
typed.


Each channel has its own filename.  The filename will be created in the 
subdirectory that you have specified to store the group chat .CAP files.  The 
actual filename is [node#].CAP.  For example, you may have a 1.CAP, 2.CAP, 
etc.  Also, any information such as when a caller joins the channel, leaves 
the channel, makes it private, etc., will also be captured.


Location for multiple nodes

It is not required that you specify the same location for the .CAP files on 
all of your nodes.  However, it would be desireable to do so in case you want 
to use a text search utility or something similar.  You could then easily 
find all of the .CAP files in one single location.


Name/Loc of Statistics File

This file is used to record the statistics that are shown on the call waiting 
screen such as the number of calls to the system, the number of uploads and 
downloads, the number of messages left, and the most recent caller 
information.


Location for multiple nodes

Because the call-waiting screen allows you to switch between local and system 
statistics, you will want to specify the same location for your Statistics 
file.  Otherwise, your system statistics will not be accurate.


Name/Loc of USERNET.XXX File

You  can think of the USERNET.XXX file as the messenger between nodes.  If 
you are running a single node system, then you do not need to worry about 
this file as it is not accessed.  This file is used for some of the following 
features in PCBoard:


Request node chats with other users
Send node broadcasts with the BR command from within PCBoard.
Protect users from logging in multiple times
Display information about who is online and what they are doing.
Drop nodes to DOS or logoff users from another node.


        Location for multiple nodes

        It is essential that all nodes point to the same physical file for 
        your USERNET.XXX file.  If they do not, you will see a situation 
        where a particular node will be isolated from the rest of the nodes 
        (they will not be able to see a list of other users that are online, 
        etc.)


Name/Loc of Transfer Summary File

This file is created by PCBoard detailing the files that have been downloaded 
or uploaded on your system.  If the callers to your system transfer a lot of 
information you may find that you have to periodically delete this file to 
reduce the amount of disk space that it uses.

The information about each file transfer is stored on a single line in the 
transfer summary file.  Each item on the line is separated by a comma and 
contains the following information:


Whether the transfer was an upload (U) or a download (D)
The name of the user who transferred the file
The date that the file was transferred
The time that the file was transferred
The filename that was transferred
File transfer protocol letter that was used
The number of transfer errors that occurred
Finally, the last item is the transfer rate in characters per seconds (cps)


NOTE:  You may choose to not keep a record of file transfers that occur by 
leaving this field blank.

        Location for multiple nodes

        This is another one of those files that it is not essential to have 
        all  nodes point to the same file, but it is desirable.  If you need 
        to keep the file transfers for a particular node seperate from the 
        entire system then go ahead and have that node point to a different 
        location.


Name/Loc of Swap File

When PCBoard is configured to swap itself out of memory during a shell 
(PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control), it will normally be 
swapped out to memory (EMS or XMS).  If there is insufficient free memory to 
hold the PCBoard memory image, it will instead be written out to disk.

In case the memory image has to be swapped to disk, you need to enter the 
filename where you want the file to be stored.  The default is to store it in 
a filename called PCBSWAP.$$$ in the current directory.

        Location for multiple nodes

        Because the PCBSWAP.$$$ contains a memory image, it is critical that 
        no two nodes share the same PCBSWAP.$$$ file.


Location of PCBTEXT Files

Virtually all of the text and prompts that PCBoard displays are contained in 
a PCBTEXT file.  Each language on your system will have a different PCBTEXT 
file that you can customize to suit your own needs with MKPCBTXT.EXE.

In this field, enter the drive and subdirectory where your PCBTEXT files will 
be stored.  If you are not using more than one language on your system, you 
will have only one PCBTEXT file.


        Location for multiple nodes

        For the sake of speed you could have each node point to local copies 
        of your PCBTEXT files.  You may find, however, that pointing all 
        nodes to one location and pre-loading your PCBTEXT files (PCBSetup | 
        Configuration Options | Configuration Switches) will increase 
        performance.  This gives you the speed advantage and also the 
        advantage of editing one set of PCBTEXT files when you need to make a 
        change.


Locations of User Index Files

The user index files are used to quickly access the name of users on the 
system and to point to their actual user record number.  These files are 
essential to the operation of your system.

In this field, enter the drive and subdirectory where you wish to store your 
user index files.  

PCBoard will maintain an index for each letter of the alphabet (PCBNDX.A 
through PCBNDX.Z).


        Location for multiple nodes

        As with the user file, all nodes should point to the same physical 
        location for storing the user index files.  If you are running a 
        network, make sure that all nodes point to the same location on the 
        server (since drive letters may vary from workstation to 
        workstation).


Location of Temporary Work Files

While users are logged into the system, it is quite likely that PCBoard will 
need to create some temporary files along the way. Each node has a temporary 
work directory where these files will be placed.  This short list shows just 
a few things that are stored in the temporary directory:


QWK mail packets (compressing and uncompressing)
Message capture files
Temporary storage (upload description until posted, etc.)


In this field, enter the drive and subdirectory where you want the temporary 
files to be stored for this particular node.  An ideal location for temporary 
files is on a RAM drive.


        Location for multiple nodes

        Each node in your multinode setup must specify a unique location for 
        their temporary work directory.  The directory that you specify must 
        not be the current or default directory.  Usually the best solution 
        is to add a TEMP directory underneath the current directory.  
        Therefore, if you are running PCBOARD.EXE from C:\PCB\NODE1 then your 
        temp files may be stored in C:\PCB\NODE1\TEMP.


Location of Help Files

There are numerous help files for PCBoard.  These help files detail 
information about commands or areas of the system that have need a more 
thorough explanation.  The format for PCBoard to look for a help file is 
HLP[option] where option is the command or topic that is being discussed.

You can also create help files for your doors or other new commands that you 
add via CMD.LST (PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration Files).  To 
accomplish this, create a text file in the directory that you specify for 
help files that has the same name as the command or door.  For example, if 
you have a door called MAIL and you wish to create a help file, you would 
create a text file called MAIL in the location you specify for your help 
files.  Then when your users ask for help with H command they can type MAIL 
and have the text file that you created displayed to them.

        Location for multiple nodes

        If you do not plan to update your help files frequently it may be a 
        good idea to have local copies for each node if you are running on a 
        network.  That way you can reduce un-necessary traffic.  If you are 
        running all of your nodes on a single computer it does not matter 
        where you store your help files as long as all nodes point to a valid 
        copy.

If you can see that you will be updating your help files frequently then you 
should store your help files in a single shared location to reduce the amount 
of maintenance on your system.


Location of Login Security Files

When a user logs into the system, PCBoard has the capability of displaying 
security specific files.  These files are displayed to the user just after 
they complete their login but before the conference news file is displayed.  
The filenames for the login security files are simply the security level of 
the caller.  For example, if you want to create a file that only security 
level 20 would see, then you create a file named 20 in the location that you 
specify for the login security files.  Because these files are normal display 
files you can also make them graphics or language specific if you wish.

        Location for multiple nodes

        Because these files are only accessed once per login, it might be 
        best to store these in a single location where all of your nodes can 
        access the files.  This will help reduce the amount of maintenance 
        you will have to do on your system.


Configuration Files


Name/Loc of PWRD/Security File

The PWRD file defines the security levels that you will use on your system.  
For each security level you can specify the following information:


Daily/session time limit
Daily kilobyte limit
Batch file limit
File and byte ratios
Maximum total file and byte limit
Initial file and byte credits
Time limit for session or entire day
Allow alias usage
Allow multiple logins

To edit your PWRD file, press F2 while you have the Name/Loc of PWRD/Security 
File field highlighted.  When you do, you will see the following screen:

There are several keyboard commands that are active when you are editing your 
PWRD file.  These keyboard commands allow you to delete entries, insert 
entries, etc.  The following are valid:


        ESC     Exit the PWRD editor.  If you have made any changes to the 
                PWRD file, you will be asked if you wish to save the changes 
                that have been made.  Afterwards, you will be returned back 
                to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the PWRD file and the various fields that you can 
                edit.

        F2      Rotate screen views.  There are 16  fields that you can edit 
                in the PWRD file.  Not all 16 can be placed on one screen. To 
                access the other fields, you need to press F2 to rotate to 
                the next set of fields.

        ALT-R   Repeat currently highlighted line.  If you are creating 
                entries for security levels that are very similar in 
                definition, you can use this keyboard command to duplicate 
                the currently highlighted entry.  The new entry will be 
                inserted just below the current line.

        ALT-I   Insert a new security level.  If you need to add a new 
                security level between two existing security levels then you 
                would using this keyboard command.  A new blank entry will be 
                inserted just below the current line that you can edit to 
                suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current security level.  This keyboard command will 
                delete the currently highlighted security level.  There is no 
                undo function to get the original line back so if you make a 
                mistake, exit without saving and attempt to make the changes 
                again.


There are several fields inside this file.  These fields allow you to control 
time limits, byte limits, and more.  The following describes each column in 
the PWRD file in detail:

Password        In order for a user to be assigned the values for a line not 
                only does their security level have to match, but also their 
                login password must match the one that you enter in the 
                Password field.  If this field is blank, then the password of 
                the user is not checked.  Do not get confused and assume that 
                if a user enters a password that is in this field that they 
                will be assigned the security level and options that you have 
                defined. This field does not work that way.

Sec             This field determines the security level that you are 
                defining.  When a user logs into the system,  PCBoard will 
                lookup the security level of the user in the PWRD file.  You 
                need to have one entry for each security level that you have 
                given to a user.  In other words, if you have assigned 
                security levels 5, 10, 20, 30, 110, and 120 to actual user 
                records then you must have a corresponding entry in the PWRD 
                file.  If you do not, PCBoard will print No security level 
                match in PWRD file and default their time to 10 minutes and 0 
                bytes when they login.

Time            The amount of time, in minutes, you wish to give a user per 
                day or per session.  If you have answered Y to the Enforce 
                Time Limit field, the time limit you enter will be for each 
                day.  If you answered N to that question, the time limit will 
                be renewed each time the user calls.

                If you enter a time limit of 0, it will cause PCBoard to 
                think that the user has accessed a Closed node or system.  A 
                lot of systems have public and private nodes.  To make a node 
                private, you would need to create a second PWRD file that had 
                a time limit of 0 for each of the security levels that you 
                wish to lock out.

Daily Bytes     The number of kilobytes (K) that you want each security level 
                to have available per day.  If you enter 0 for the number of 
                bytes available then it effectively disables downloads unless 
                they are defined as FREE or NOTIME downloads by the FSEC file

                To give a security level unlimited download bytes you can 
                enter 32767.  A user who has unlimited download bytes can 
                download files until they run out of time.

Base Baud       This field allows you to adjust the maximum daily download 
                "K-Byte" limit based on the speed of the caller.  For 
                example, you may want to allow 2400 bps callers to download 
                400k per day.  You could set the kilobytes per day to 400k 
                per day. However, to your high speed callers who may have the 
                same security level, 400k may not seem to be enough.  By 
                setting the base baud rate to 2400 and the kilobytes per day 
                to 400 you will be giving your 9600 bps callers 1600k.  They 
                get four times the amount of bytes because they are calling 
                in at a speed which is four times greater than 2400.

                As a general rule, you will want to enter the base baud rate 
                as the lowest bps rate that callers will be calling in.  In 
                the previous example the base baud rate was set for 400k if a 
                2400 bps caller and at 1600k if the user was a 9600 bps. This 
                is more desirable than defining it at 1600k for 9600 bps and 
                letting PCBoard size it down.

Batch Limit     This field defines the number of files that a user can 
                transfer in a batch transfer.  For example, if you want a 
                user to download a maximum of 5 files in each batch, enter 5 
                in this field.  You may enter any number from 0 to 99 in this 
                field.  If you enter 0, the maximum batch is set to a default 
                of 30 files.

                You can disable batch transfers for all users on your system 
                with the Disallow BATCH Uploads switch in PCBSetup | 
                Configuration Switches | File Transfers.

File Ratio      If you want to control the number of files that a user can 
                download based on how many files they have uploaded to the 
                system, you want to enforce a file ratio.  In this field, 
                enter the number of downloads that you want the user to be 
                able to download for each file that they upload.  For 
                example, if you enter 4.0 in this field, a user must upload 1 
                file for every 4 files they download.  Entering a value of 
                0.0 will disable the file ratio.

Byte Ratio      If you want to control the number of bytes that a user can 
                download based on how many files they have uploaded to the 
                system, you want to enforce a byte ratio.  In this field, 
                enter the number of bytes you want to allow the user to 
                download before they must upload another byte.  In other 
                words, if you want your users to be able to download 20 bytes 
                for every byte they upload, enter a value of 20.0 in this 
                field.  Entering a value of 0.0 will disable the file ratio.

File Limit      If you wish to control the total number of files that a user 
                of the security level you are defining can download, you want 
                to impose a file limit.  In this field, enter the maximum 
                number of files that a user can download from your system.  
                Once this limit has been reached, the caller cannot download 
                any more files.  This type of limit would be ideal if you are 
                using a "pay-as-you-go" type system where you allow a user to 
                download a certain amount of files for some sort of 
                compensation.

                When the file limit has been reached, you can reset the total 
                files downloaded field in System Manager (while editing a 
                user record) once more compensation has been received.

                As with the other limits that you can define in the PWRD 
                file, entering a File Limit of 0 will disable the limit 
                checking.

                NOTE:  Any file that is specified as a FREE or NOTIME 
                download in the FSEC file will not be counted as a file 
                downloaded by a user.

KByte Limit     If you wish to control the total number of bytes that a user 
                of the security level you are defining can download, you will 
                be enforcing a byte limit.  In this field, enter the maximum 
                number of bytes a user can download from your system. Once 
                this limit has been reached, the caller cannot download any 
                more bytes.  This type of limit would be ideal if you are 
                using a "pay-as-you-go" type system where you allow a user to 
                download a certain amount of bytes in exchange for some sort 
                of compensation.

                When the byte limit has been reached, you can reset the total 
                bytes downloaded field in System Manager (while editing a 
                user record) once more compensation has been received.

                As with the other limits you can define in the PWRD file, 
                entering a kilobyte limit of 0 will disable the limit 
                checking.

                NOTE:  Any file that is specified as a FREE or NOTIME 
                download in the FSEC file will not be counted as bytes 
                downloaded by a user.

The rest of the fields that you can define in the PWRD file must be accessed 
by pressing F2 to rotate the screen view.  Once you have pressed F2, you will 
see the following additional fields:

File Credit     This field gives you the ability to implement a grace period 
                if you are enforcing a file ratio.  The value that you enter 
                in this field will be seen as an upload credit as if the user 
                had really uploaded this many files.  Sometimes it takes 
                users a while to become familiar with a ratio system.  In a 
                situation such as this, you may want to give your users an 
                initial upload file credit.

                For instance, if the File Credit is set at 10 then the caller 
                may download 10 files before reaching a 1:1 ratio.  A total 
                of 20 files can be downloaded before a 2:1 ratio would 
                prevent the downloading of a 21st file.

K-Byte Cred.    This field gives you the ability to implement a grace period 
                if you are enforcing a byte ratio.  The value that you enter 
                in this field will be seen as an upload credit as if the user 
                had really uploaded this many bytes.  Sometimes it takes 
                users a while to become familiar with a ratio system.  In a 
                situation such as this, you may want to give your users an 
                initial upload byte credit.

                For instance, with a byte ratio of 10.0 a brand new caller 
                would be able to download, at most, a single 10-byte file.  
                To make it more fair, you could give the user an initial 
                credit of 20 kilobytes.  Then the caller would be able to 
                download as much as 200 kilobytes before they would exceed 
                their ratio.

Enforce Time    With this setting you can choose if the time limit that you 
                defined is a daily time limit or a session time limit. A 
                setting of Y enforces the time limit to be a per-day limit.  
                A setting of N would enforce a session limit letting the user 
                log back in immediately and get the time limit defined for 
                their security level each time they call in.

Allow Alias     If you have installed the Alias PSA, you can control which 
                security levels will be able to use Alias names in those 
                conferences that allow aliases.  If you want a security level 
                to be able to use an alias, this option must be enabled.

Force Read      For some security levels, you may want to force callers to 
                read mail that they have been notified is waiting for them.  
                If you do, you should enable this option.  As soon as the 
                user of this security level receives a you have mail 
                waiting... message, PCBoard will force the user to read this 
                mail in read-only mode (will not update the last message 
                read).  For the user to be notified, their message waiting 
                flags have to be set.

                NOTE:  Not all third-party software will update the message 
                waiting flags, but PCBoard always will.

Demo Acct.      Setting this answer to Y will allow a user at this security 
                level to log into the system multiple times.  In other words, 
                you could have an account on your system that you could use 
                for demonstration purposes.  With this setting, you could 
                have several users logging into your system using that 
                account whereas PCBoard normally disallows users of the same 
                name from logging in at the same time.  If you use accounts 
                with this security level for demonstrating then you may want 
                to clear out the password field in your demonstration 
                accounts.  With a blank password, PCBoard will not prompt the 
                caller to enter a password.

                NOTE:  When set to allow multiple logins, PCBoard protects 
                the W user command and also resets the last message read 
                pointers because they are seen as demonstration accounts.

Name/Loc of FSEC File

The FSEC file gives you the ability to control the following:


Protecting files for download by security level or by password
Determining what files are free downloads


Whenever a user attempts to download a file, PCBoard will first check your 
DLPATH.LST for the current conference to see if the file can be found.  If 
the file is found, then PCBoard will check your FSEC file to make sure that 
the user has sufficient security or knows the correct password to download 
the file. To edit your FSEC file, press F2 while you have the Name/Loc of 
FSEC File field highlighted.  When you do, you will see the following screen:

There are several keyboard commands active when you are editing your FSEC 
file.  These keyboard commands allow you to delete entries, insert entries, 
etc.  The following are valid:

        ESC     Exit the FSEC editor.  If you have made any changes to the 
                FSEC file, you will be asked if you wish to save the changes 
                that have been made.  After answering, you will be returned 
                back to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the FSEC file and the various fields you can edit.

        ALT-R   Repeat currently highlighted line.  If you are creating 
                entries that are very similar  in definition, you can use 
                this keyboard command to duplicate the currently highlighted 
                entry. The new entry will be inserted just below the current 
                line.

        ALT-I   Insert a new security level.  If you need to add a new entry 
                between two existing entries, you would using this keyboard 
                command.  A new blank entry will be inserted just below the 
                current line that you can edit to suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current security level.  This keyboard command will 
                delete the currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo 
                function to get the original line back so if you make a 
                mistake, you should exit without saving and attempt to make 
                the changes again.

You will notice there are three fields in this file.  These fields allow you 
to specify the subdirectory and/or filename(s) you wish to control and the 
security and/or password required to access the file.

Drive \ Path    In this field, specify the subdirectory you wish to control 
                access to.  You can enter any valid DOS path in this field.  
                Make sure that whatever you enter in this field matches one 
                of your entries in your DLPATH.LST file or it will be 
                ignored.  For example, if you enter C:\RESTRICT\ in this 
                field but in your DLPATH.LST is the entry \RESTRICT\, a match 
                will not occur.

                If you wish to control access to an entire drive, enter the 
                drive letter followed by a colon.  For example, to control 
                access to all of drive F, enter F: in the field.

                If you leave this field blank, whatever you enter for the 
                filename will be controlled no matter what download path it 
                is found in.  For example, if you have a bunch of files in 
                different subdirectories that begin with FAQ,  save yourself 
                several entries in the FSEC file by leaving the Drive \ Path 
                field blank and enter FAQ*.* in the filename field.

File Name       In this field you should enter the filename you wish to 
                protect.  You may enter any valid DOS filename or wildcard in 
                this field.  For example, if you wish to simply protect 
                SALE0393.ARJ, you would enter that filename in this field. 
                However, if you wished to protect every file that begins with 
                SALE, you would enter SALE*.* in this field.

                If you leave this field blank, every filename that is found 
                in the subdirectory that you entered in the Drive \Path field 
                will be protected.  In other words, this field defaults to 
                *.* (all files).

Sec             In this field, enter the security level that is required to 
                download the file(s) defined by the first two fields.  If you 
                enter a security level of 0, it is assumed that the file is a 
                FREE file that does not get recorded as a downloaded file in 
                the user's record.

Password        The password field allows you to enter a password that is 
                required in order to download the files that are defined by 
                the first two fields.  There are two exceptions and those are 
                the words FREE and NOTIME.  These two passwords have special 
                meaning in PCBoard.  The FREE password will make it so that 
                the files or bytes downloaded do not get updated when a user 
                downloads a FREE file.  NOTIME is only slightly different in 
                that no time is deducted for downloading a NOTIME file.

                Once the password has been entered, it will not be asked for 
                again during the session.  This means that if the user's 
                login password is the same as the file password, the password 
                will not be asked when attempting to download  a file 
                protected with the same password.

The order that you list the entries in your FSEC file are very important 
because PCBoard will act on the first match that it finds.  Therefore, you 
will want to list your most specific entries at the top and your more generic 
entries towards the bottom of the file.  For example:

          
          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password

-------------------------------- -------------- -----  --------------
                                  *.*             20
 Q:\FREE\                         MEMBER*.*        0   FREE


This example would not work because every file would match on the first entry 
and PCBoard would act on it.  Instead, you would want to reverse these 
entries so that PCBoard checks to see if the file is in Q:\FREE\ first.

As a general rule, you could order your FSEC in the following
manner:


* Entry has a subdirectory and a filename specified
* Entry has a subdirectory but no filename specified
* Entry has only a filename specified
* Entry has *.* for a filename and no subdirectory specified.
* Perhaps the simplest example would be if you wanted to allow any user to 
  get files from your Y:\FREE\ subdirectory but only users who have a 
  security level of 20 or higher can download any other files.  In this case 
  you would make the following entries in your FSEC file:


          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password

-------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
 Y:\FREE\                         *.*              0   FREE
                                  *.*             20


As another example, let's assume you want to protect the files in two 
subdirectories with a particular password.  In this case, you would make the 
following entries:'


          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password

-------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
 Q:\CHARTS\                       *.*             20   MAKE_MY_DAY!
 R:\SALES\                        *.*             20   CHERRY-PIE


Finally, let's assume that you have a CD-ROM on-line as drive X. You only 
want to allow those users which have contributed to your system (level 50 or 
above) to download files from your CD-ROM.  You want to protect all of the 
files in drive X but you certainly do not want to have to enter all of the 
subdirectories into the FSEC file.  In the Drive \ Path field.  Instead, 
enter the drive letter you wish to protect as in the following example:


          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password

-------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
 X:                               *.*             50


Name/Loc of UPSEC File

The UPSEC file is very similar to the FSEC file except that it allows you to 
control the files that get uploaded to your system rather than the files that 
are downloaded.  For instance, you may decide to only accept files that have 
a .ZIP extension.  If this is what you desire, then the UPSEC file is where 
you will configure your system to do this.

Whenever a user attempts to download a file, PCBoard will first check your 
DLPATH.LST for the current conference to see if the file can be found.  If 
the file is found, PCBoard will check your UPSEC file to make sure that the 
user has sufficient security or knows the correct password to upload the 
file. To edit your UPSEC file, press F2 while you have the Name/Loc of UPSEC 
File field highlighted.  When you do, you will see the following screen:

There are several keyboard commands that are active when you are editing your 
UPSEC file.  These keyboard commands allow you to delete entries, insert 
entries, etc.  The following are valid:

        ESC     Exit the UPSEC editor.  If you have made any changes to the 
                UPSEC file, you will be asked if you wish to save the changes 
                that have been made.  Afterwards, you will be returned back 
                to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the UPSEC file and the various fields you can 
                edit.

        ALT-R   Repeat currently highlighted line.  If you are creating 
                entries that are very similar  in definition, you can use 
                this keyboard command to duplicate the currently highlighted 
                entry. The new entry will be inserted just below the current 
                line.
                      
        ALT-I   Insert a new security level.  If you need to add a new entry 
                between two existing entries, you would using this keyboard 
                command.  A new blank entry will be inserted just below the 
                current line that you can edit to suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current security level.  This keyboard command will 
                delete the currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo 
                function to get the original line back so if you make a 
                mistake, exit without saving and attempt to make the changes 
                again.

You will notice there are three fields in this file.  These fields allow you 
to specify the subdirectory and/or filename(s) you wish to control and the 
security and/or password required to access the file.

Drive \ Path    In this field, specify the subdirectory you wish to control 
                access to.  You can enter any valid DOS path in this field.  
                If you wish to control access to an entire drive, enter the 
                drive letter followed by a colon.  For example, to control 
                access to all of drive F then you would enter F: in the 
                field.

                If you leave this field blank, it is the same as saying any 
                drive and any subdirectory on the entire system.

File Name       In this field you should enter the filename you wish to 
                protect.  You may enter any valid DOS filename or wildcard in 
                this field.  For example, if you wish to prevent users from 
                uploading any filename that ends with a .COM extension, enter 
                *.COM in this field.

                If you leave this field blank, every filename that is found 
                in the subdirectory that you entered in the Drive \Path field 
                will be protected.  In other words, this field defaults to 
                *.* (all files) when left blank.

Sec             In this field, enter the security level that is required to 
                upload the file(s) that are defined by the first two fields.  
                If you enter a security level of 0,  anyone may upload the 
                files specified.

Password        The password field allows you to enter a password that is 
                required in order to upload the files that are defined by the 
                first two fields.  Once the user has entered the password, 
                they will not be asked for it again during that session.  
                This means that if the user's login password is the same as 
                the file password, the password for the file will not be 
                asked for.

The order that you list the entries in your UPSEC file are very important 
because PCBoard will act on the first match that it finds.  Therefore, you 
will want to list your most specific entries at the top and your more generic 
entries towards the bottom of the file.  For example:

          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password
-------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
                                  *.*             20
 Q:\CONF1\PRIVUPLD\               *.GIF            0


This example would not work because every file would match on the first entry 
and PCBoard would act on it.  Instead, you would want to reverse these 
entries so that PCBoard checks to see if the upload would go to 
Q:\CONF1\PRIVUPLD\ first.

As a general rule, you could order your UPSEC in the following
manner:


* Entry has a subdirectory and a filename specified
* Entry has a subdirectory but no filename specified
* Entry has only a filename specified
* Entry has *.* for a filename and no subdirectory specified.


Perhaps the most practical example would be to illustrate how you make it so 
that users could only upload compressed files and only those compressed files 
that you wish to allow.  You could create the following FSEC file for 
allowing only *.ZIP files to be uploaded to your system:

          Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec     Password

-------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
                                  *.ZIP            0
                                  *.*            100


When a user uploads a file, PCBoard will check the UPSEC file to see if the 
filename ends with .ZIP.  If it does not, it proceeds onto the next entry in 
the file.  Obviously the last entry will match any file that is uploaded.  
The catch, however, is that if no matches were found on the previous entries 
in your UPSEC file, they will not be able to upload the file unless their 
security level is 100 or higher.

Another example would be if you wanted to allow .ZIP files to be uploaded 
anywhere on your system but you only wanted .GIF files to be uploaded in 
conference #3.  In a case such as this, you would make the following UPSEC 
file:

           Drive \ Path              File Name    Sec    Password
 -------------------------------- -------------- ----- --------------
  D:\CONF3\PRIVUPLD\               *.GIF            0
                                   *.ZIP            0
                                   *.*            100


PCBoard sends all uploads initially to the private upload directory so make 
sure if you are trying to protect uploads to a particular conference, enter 
the location of the private uploads regardless of whether all uploads are 
public or private.  This example assumes the private upload directory for 
conference #3 is D:\CONF3\PRIVUPLD\.  As you can see, a user could only 
upload a filename that ends with .GIF if the private upload directory for the 
conference is D:\CONF3\PRIVUPLD.

Name/Loc of User Trashcan File

The trashcan file gives you the ability to protect users from creating 
accounts with user names that are listed in your trashcan file.  This means 
that you can protect users from logging into your system with words that you 
may find offensive.

To edit the trashcan file, you highlight the field on the screen which says 
Name/Loc of User Trashcan File and then press F2. When you do, you will see a 
screen similar to the following:

In the trashcan file editor, the following keyboard commands are available:

        ESC     Exit the trashcan editor.  If you have made any changes to 
                the trashcan file, you will be asked if you wish to save the 
                changes that have been made.  Afterwards, you will be 
                returned back to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the trashcan file.

        PgDn    View the next 15 entries.  On each screen of the trashcan 
                editor, 15 entries can be displayed.  If you want to view the 
                next 15 entries in the file, use this keyboard command.

        PgUp    View the previous 15 entries.  To view the previous 15 
                entries of the trashcan file, use this keyboard command.

        ALT-I   Insert a new line.  If you need to add a new entry between two 
                existing entries, use this keyboard command.  A new blank 
                entry will be inserted just below the current line that you 
                can edit to suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current line.  This keyboard command will delete the 
                currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo function to 
                get the original line back. If you make a mistake, exit 
                without saving and attempt to make the changes again.

The trashcan file is accessed whenever a new user logs into a system.  If any 
of the entries in the trashcan file are part of the new user's name, PCBoard 
will not allow them to continue. For example, if you have the word ENTER in 
your trashcan file a user could login as THE ENTERPRISE, but not as ENTER THE 
NIGHT. The key difference is that ENTER is not a separate word in the name.

As another example, if you have the word THE in the trashcan file, a user 
name such as THE WIND, or THE WILD ONE would fail. A name such as JOHN THEOS 
would not fail because the word THE does not exist as an entire single word.

Name/Loc of Protocol Data File

The protocol data file is the configuration file that stores information 
about the file transfer protocols that are available on your system.  In 
order to transfer files from your system to the remote user's system or vice 
versa, a file transfer protocol must be used.  There is no one standard file 
transfer protocol, therefore, PCBoard gives you the ability to define up to 
36 different protocols for your system.

To edit your protocol data file, highlight the line which says Name/Loc of 
Protocol Data File and press F2.  When you do, you will see the following 
screen:

The protocol data file consists of seven fields for each
protocol entry.  The following describes each field in detail:

 Use            Each protocol in PCBoard is referenced by a protocol letter 
                rather than the name of the protocol.  The letter that you 
                enter in this field is the letter that will be used while 
                on-line to reference the protocol.  You may enter any letter 
                or number (A-Z and 0-9) for a total of 36 possible protocol 
                definitions.

 Type           This field describes the type of protocol that you are 
                defining.  The following are the valid options:

                I  Internal.  An internal protocol is one that is implemented 
                inside of PCBoard itself.  You could call these built-in 
                protocols if you wish.  There are seven protocols that are 
                internal to PCBoard:


                     (A) ASCII
                     (X) XModem/Checksum
                     (C) Xmodem/CRC
                     (O) 1K-Xmodem
                     (F) 1K-Xmodem/G
                     (Y) Ymodem BATCH
                     (G) Ymodem/G BATCH

                If you are defining an internal protocol, you must use the 
                appropriate protocol letter (shown in parentheses in the 
                internal protocol list) for the internal protocol to be used.

                S  Shelled.  This type of protocol refers to an external 
                protocol (one that is not built into PCBoard).  You should 
                define an external protocol as this type if it is a single 
                file transfer protocol (not capable of batch transfers) or if 
                it does not use the DSZLOG style log for recording transfer 
                activity. If you define a protocol as this type, PCBoard will 
                not let a user transfer more than one file at a time.

                D  DSZLog.  This type of protocol refers to an external 
                protocol. Any protocol that is capable of recording transfer 
                information in the DSZLOG style format should use this 
                protocol type. If you are unsure if the protocol you are 
                trying to add supports DSZ style logging, please refer to the 
                protocol documentation or the author of the protocol.  
                PCBoard will allow callers to use any protocol of this type 
                for batch file transfers.

                B  Bi-directional.  You should only define a protocol as this 
                type if it is capable of sending and receiving files at the 
                same time.  Only a handful of protocols exist that support 
                bi-directional transfers. If you do use a protocol that 
                supports bi-directional transfers, make sure that it also 
                supports DSZLOG style logging.  If it does not, PCBoard will 
                not be able to properly determine the files that were 
                transferred.

 Size           Just before PCBoard begins a download it will print the size 
                of the file(s) that will be transferred and approximately how 
                many protocol blocks required to transfer the file.  Each 
                protocol uses a packet or block size.  Most of the advanced 
                protocols will send 1024 bytes at a time whereas protocol 
                like Xmodem will send 128 bytes at a time. PCBoard uses the 
                value that you enter in this field to determine how many 
                protocol blocks will be transferred.  This information really 
                is purely statistical in nature and the protocol will 
                continue to function properly even if you do not enter the 
                right value.

 MNP            Some file transfers protocols will off-load the error 
                correction on the modems in order to get better throughput.  
                If you are installing a protocol which relies on error 
                correcting modems, enter Y in this field.  When this field is 
                set to Y, a user may only select this protocol if they have 
                established an error correcting connection (e.g., MNP, v.42, 
                etc.)  For this to work properly, both your modem and the 
                remote modem must have established an error-correcting 
                connection.

 Port Open      Normally, PCBoard will shut down the RTS signal and unhook 
                itself from the serial port interrupt prior to executing an 
                external protocol.  It is then up to the external protocol to 
                initialize the serial port for proper communications.  This 
                is the method that nearly every external protocol expects to 
                function properly.  However, some protocols may require that 
                PCBoard leave the port 'as-is' before turning control over to 
                the external protocol.  If you run into a protocol that 
                absolutely requires this then set this field to Y.  If you 
                are not sure, leave this option set to N or you could see 
                some unpredictable results when you return back to PCBoard 
                from the external protocol.

 Lock Lines     The status lines, which PCBoard moves to the top of the 
                screen during a shelled protocol, may be frozen in place to 
                avoid having them scrolled off the top of the screen.  This 
                way you can see who is on-line transferring files when users 
                are using external protocols.  This only works for those 
                external protocols which use BIOS to write to the screen or 
                if the protocol does not write to the top two lines of the 
                screen.  To lock the lines in position, set this option to Y.

 Description    In this field, enter a short description of the protocol that 
                is being defined.  This description is displayed to the 
                caller whenever they are choosing from the list of protocols 
                that have been defined on your system.  You may enter up to 
                37 characters to describe each file transfer protocol.

As mentioned previously, internal protocols are built in PCBoard.  External 
protocols are separate programs and are not really related to PCBoard.  Batch 
files are used to execute external protocols.  PCBoard expects these batch 
files to be named in the following manner:

        PCBR?.BAT       where ? is the protocol letter of the external 
                        protocol you are defining.  This batch file will be 
                        executed whenever you receive a file (a user uploads 
                        to your system).

        PCBS?.BAT       where ? is the protocol letter of the external 
                        protocol you are defining.  This batch file will be 
                        executed whenever your send a file (a user downloads 
                        from your system).

An external version of Zmodem is included with your package.  If you look in 
the directory where you installed PCBoard, you will see a PCBRZ.BAT and a 
PCBSZ.BAT file.  These are the two batch files that will get executed when a 
user requests Zmodem for their transfer protocol.  For further information on 
setting up external protocols please see the Batch Files chapter of this 
Manual.

NOTE:  If you have defined a protocol and it is not showing up when a user 
attempts to set their default protocol, it may be due to one of the 
following:

The protocol that is not being listed is marked as a protocol that requires 
an error-correcting session (MNP or v.42).  The user that is on-line has not 
established an error-correcting session (the connect speed on the status line 
does not have an E on the end). 

The protocol that is not listed is an external protocol and one or both of 
the external protocol batch files are missing.


Name/Loc of Multi-Lang. Data File

The multi-language data file is the file that controls what languages (if 
any) are defined for use on your system.  The ability to configure multiple 
languages on your system gives you the ability to cater to more users who may 
not speak the same language.

To edit the multi-language data file highlight the line on the screen that 
says Name/Loc of Multi-Lang. Data File and press F2. You will see a screen 
which resembles the following:

The following describes each of the fields in this file:

Language        The name of the language.  This is the text that is displayed 
                to the caller when they are asked to choose a language at 
                login.  You should include the number of the language on this 
                line.  The first language in the file will be assigned 
                language #1, the second language will get language #2, etc.

Extension       The filename extension for language specific files. For 
                example, if you are adding the French language, you may want 
                to make the extension .FRE.  This means if you had a file 
                called WELCOME.FRE it would be displayed to anyone who 
                selected the French language at login.

Country         If you also want PCBoard to add date, numerical separator, 
                and capitalization support for the language that you are 
                defining, you need to enter the country number to use as 
                defined by COUNTRY.SYS.  For the French language this would 
                be 033.

CodePage        The code page is also a function of COUNTRY.SYS and defines 
                what characters are available in the language you are 
                defining.  This information should be provided in your 
                operating system manual.  As an example, the French language 
                would use 850 in this field.

Yes             Since Yes and No are not the same in all languages, you can 
                define what character will be used to represent a response of 
                Yes.  In French, you most likely would like to use the letter 
                O.

No              As with the Yes field, the language you are defining may use 
                a character other than N to represent a response of No.  
                Simply enter the character that you wish to use to represent 
                a response of No.

There are several keyboard commands which give you the ability
to add and delete entries, and more.  They are as follows:

        ESC     Exit the multilingual editor.  If you have made any changes 
                to the multilingual file, you will be asked if you wish to 
                save the changes that have been made.  Afterwards, you will 
                be returned back to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the PCBML.DAT file.

        PgDn    View the next 15 entries.  On each screen of the multilingual 
                editor, 15 entries can be displayed.  If you want to view the 
                next 15 entries in the file, use this keyboard command.

        PgUp    View the previous 15 entries.  To view the previous 15 
                entries,  use this keyboard command.

        ALT-I   Insert a new line.  If you need to add a new entry between 
                two existing entries, use this keyboard command.  A new blank 
                entry will be inserted just below the current line that you 
                can edit to suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current line.  This keyboard command will delete the 
                currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo function to 
                get the original line back.  If you make a mistake, exit 
                without saving and attempt to make the changes again.

For more information about the country code and code page information please 
see the discussion about COUNTRY.SYS in the Internationalization section of 
the Customizing  Your BBS chapter of this manual.


Name/Loc of Color Definition File

PCBFiler has a menu option you can use to customize the colors used in your 
directory files.  PCBoard will read this information from PCBFiler 
configuration file (PCBFILER.DEF) to colorize your directory files 
on-the-fly.  The configuration file will be created in the same directory as 
PCBFILER.EXE.

In this field, enter the location and name of your PCBFILER.DEF file.  If the 
PCBFILER.DEF file cannot be found in the location that you specify, your file 
directories will appear in monochrome rather than the colors that you desire.

Name/Loc of Default CMD.LST File

The CMD.LST file defines commands that you can be used to add, change, or 
even replace commands available to your callers.  You can define commands 
that stuff the keyboard with certain text, run PPE files, or execute a menu 
file.  In this field, enter the name and location of the default CMD.LST 
file.  This file will be used in any conferences that do not have a 
conference specific file defined.

To edit this file, highlight the line which says Name/Loc of Default CMD.LST 
File and then press F2.  You will see a screen which resembles the one on the 
following page:

While in this editor, these keyboard commands are available:

        ESC     Exit the CMD.LST editor.  If you have made any changes to the 
                CMD.LST file, you will be asked if you wish to save the 
                changes that have been made.  Afterwards, you will be 
                returned back to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that
                relates to the CMD.LST file.

        PgDn    View the next 15 entries.  On each screen of the trashcan 
                editor, 15 entries can be displayed.  If you want to view the 
                next 15 entries in the file, use this keyboard command.

        PgUp    View the previous 15 entries.  To view the previous 15 
                entries of the CMD.LST file, use this keyboard command.

        ALT-I   Insert a new line.  If you need to add a new entry between 
                two existing entries,  use this keyboard command.  A new 
                blank entry will be inserted just below the current line that 
                you can edit to suit your needs.

        ALT-D   Delete current line.  This keyboard command will delete the 
                currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo function to 
                get the original line back.  If you make a mistake, exit 
                without saving and then attempt to make the changes again.

        ALT-R   Repeat current line.  If you are creating entries that are 
                very similar  in definition, use this keyboard command to 
                duplicate the currently highlighted entry.  The new entry 
                will be inserted just below the current line.

There are three fields that are used to define each command in
the CMD.LST file.  The following describes each field in detail:

Command         You can enter up to 15 characters to define a command. The 
                text entered in this field will be used whenever the command 
                is executed.  For example, if you enter MAIL in this field, a 
                user must type MAIL to access the command you are defining.

Security        In this field, enter the security level that is required to 
                execute the entry you are defining.  If the user does not 
                have a security level equal to or greater than the number 
                that you enter, a Menu Selection is not available message 
                will be displayed to the user.

Replacement     When a caller executes a command you define, you can have the 
                command run a .PPE file, a .MNU file, or have it simulate the 
                user keystrokes.

If you wish to run a .PPE file then specify the full path and filename you 
wish to run including the .PPE extension.  If the filename that you specify 
cannot be found, no action will occur when the command is executed.

To run a .MNU file specify the full path and filename that you wish to run 
including the .MNU extension.  If the filename that you specify cannot be 
found then no action will occur when the command is executed.

If you do not specify a .MNU or a .PPE file then the text that you enter in 
this field will be stuffed into the keyboard so that it appears that the user 
actually typed the text that is in this field.  This would be useful to 
combine frequently used commands into one easy to remember command.

Any commands that you define in the CMD.LST file will be found before any 
other internal command or door name is executed. This is the reason that any 
commands that you define in this file will override internal commands of the 
same name.

If you define a command that is more than one character in length, you do not 
have to type in the entire command for PCBoard to act on it.  PCBoard simply 
needs is to be able to guarantee that what is typed will make it a unique 
command.  For example, if you have a command named ORDER as the only entry in 
CMD.LST, you could enter OR to open the command because there are no others 
beginning with OR either as an internal command or in your CMD.LST file.

As another example, you could create a command called NEWFILES that would 
stuff N;S;A into the keyboard.  This would provide an easy way for your users 
to display the new files in a particular conference without having to 
remember to type in a more cryptic command such as N;S;A.  To define this new 
command, make the following entry in CMD.LST:


    Command     Security  PPE/MNU File -or- Keystroke Replacement
--------------  --------  ---------------------------------------
NEWFILES            0     N;S;A^M


Assuming that you have a .PPE file that you wish to run in place of the E 
user command you could make the following entry in your CMD.LST file:


    Command     Security  PPE/MNU File -or- Keystroke Replacement
--------------  --------  ---------------------------------------
E                   0     C:\PCB\PPE\EMSG.PPE


As you can see by this sample entry, any time a user executes the E user 
command, PCBoard will run EMSG.PPE located in the C:\PCB\PPE\ subdirectory 
instead.

Having a command execute a .MNU file is just as simple as running a .PPE 
file.  All you have to do is to specify the name of the .MNU file that you 
wish to run as shown in the following entry:


    Command     Security  PPE/MNU File -or- Keystroke Replacement
--------------  --------  ---------------------------------------
ORDER               0     C:\PCB\MNU\ORDER.MNU


This entry will execute C:\PCB\MNU\ORDER.MNU whenever a user types in the 
ORDER command.

Name/Loc of All-Files DLPATH.LST

If you have files available for download in several conferences, you may want 
to use this file to protect users from uploading files which do not exist in 
the current conference but may exist in another conference on the system.

Normally, PCBoard will check the DLPATH.LST file of the current conference to 
see if the files a user wishes to upload duplicates any files already on the 
system.  Since a different DLPATH.LST file can be specified for each 
conference this means you would not be able to check for duplicates across 
conferences.

If there are entries in the The All-Files DLPATH.LST (ALLFILES.LST) file, 
PCBoard will use that file to check for duplicates when a user is uploading a 
file.   The ALLFILES.LST file is not used at any time for downloading 
purposes so you may include every path on your system if you wish.

To edit your ALLFILES.LST file, highlight the line on the screen that says 
Name/Loc of All-Files DLPATH.LST and press F2.  You will see a screen which 
resembles the following:

While you are in the editor, the following keyboard commands are available:


        ESC     Exit the ALLFILES.LST editor.  If you have made any changes 
                to the ALLFILES.LST file, you will be asked if you wish to 
                save the changes that have been made.  Afterwards, you will 
                be returned back to the Configuration Files menu.

        F1      Access on-line help.  On-line help will be displayed that 
                relates to the all-files DLPATH.LST file.
 
        PgDn    View the next 15 entries.  On each screen of the DLPATH.LST 
                editor, 15 entries can be displayed.  If you want to view the 
                next 15 entries in the file, you would use this keyboard 
                command.

        PgUp    View the previous 15 entries.  To view the previous 15 
                entries of the DLPATH.LST file, use this keyboard command.

        ALT-I   Insert a new line.  If you need to add a new entry between 
                two existing entries, use this keyboard command.  A new blank 
                entry will be inserted just below the current line.

        ALT-D   Delete current line.  This keyboard command will delete the 
                currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo function to 
                get the original line back.  If you make a mistake, exit 
                without saving and then attempt to make the changes again.

        ALT-R   Repeat current line.  If you are creating entries that are 
                very similar  in definition, use this keyboard command to 
                duplicate the currently highlighted entry.  The new entry 
                will be inserted just below the current line.

Perhaps the easiest way for you to create your ALLFILES.LST would be to use 
the DOS COPY command to combine the DLPATH.LST files that you use in your 
various conferences into one single file called ALLFILES.LST.  This method 
would be faster than manually entering each path or index file into the file.

NOTE:  You should also add the private upload directory path for each 
conference in your ALLFILES.LST if you want PCBoard to check these 
directories since they are not normally included in your conference 
DLPATH.LST files.

As a quick example, let's assume that you have defined two conferences on 
your system.  In both conferences you have different files available for 
download.  You decide that the ALLFILES.LST would be the best way to protect 
from getting unwanted duplicate files.  First, you use the COPY command in 
DOS to combine your DLPATH.LST files for your conferences by typing the 
following:


COPY C:\PCB\CONF1\DLPATH.LST+C:\PCB\CONF2\DLPATH.LST C:\PCB\ALLFILES.LST


Next, add the public and private upload directory paths for the two 
conferences into your ALLFILES.LST so that it resembles the screen on the 
following page:


Name/Loc of Upload File Trashcan

This configuration file has one purpose -- to stop users from uploading 
certain filenames.  If a user attempts to upload a file which is in this list 
then PCBoard will print an error that says Files matching ([filename]) are 
not allowed on this system. To edit your upload file trashcan you need to 
highlight the line on the screen which says Name/Loc of Upload File Trashcan 
and press F2.

Inside the upload file trashcan editor, you may specify any valid DOS 
filename or wildcard.  Use the up and down cursor keys to move between fields 
and type in the filename or wildcard filename you wish to disallow all users 
to upload.

Batch file for viewing compressed files

In this field, enter the name of the batch file you wish to execute when a 
user executes the F;V user command to view a file available for download.  
PCBoard will execute the batch file specified in this field.  In addition, 
PCBoard will pass the full path and filename being viewed as the first 
parameter to the batch file.

The default PCBVIEW.BAT included with your package makes use of VIEWZIP.EXE 
and VIEWARCH.COM that are also supplied with your package.  These two 
utilities allow you to  list the files contained in .ZIP and .ARC compressed 
files.

Filename EXTENSION for compressed files

Usually a bulletin board system will pick a particular compression program to 
compress all of the files on-line.  For example, you may decide that you want 
all of your files to be in .ZIP format.  This field allows you to specify the 
default extension for compressed files.  This extension will be used in the 
following places:

When flagging or requesting a file for download, PCBoard will attempt to find 
a filename with the compressed filename extension if no extension is supplied 
by the user.  This can save keystrokes because the extension would not have 
to be entered.

When using the F;V command PCBoard will attempt to find a filename with the 
compressed filename extension if no extension is supplied by the user.  This 
can save keystrokes because the extension would not have to be entered.

If a bulletin is requested for download, PCBoard will check to see if a file 
exists in the same location as the bulletin file that has the same filename 
and also an extension that matches the compressed filename extension.  If 
such a file exists, the compressed version of the file will be downloaded  
instead of the ASCII text version.  This allows you to have large bulletins 
on-line but for users to easily (and quickly) download a compressed version 
of the bulletin.

Display Files

When you select this menu option, you will be presented with the following 
screen which lists some of the display files you can change the location of 
or even edit:

PCBoard makes use of several display files.  These display files are text 
files that will be displayed to the caller.  Text files allow you to easily 
customize the information you wish to present to the user.  You can make your 
file large or small, colorized or monochrome.  The point is that you have the 
choice.

All of the display files that are listed on this screen can have graphics, 
security, and language specific versions.  See Display Files in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual for additional information..  In 
each of the fields on this screen, enter the drive, path, and filename that 
you wish to use for each display file.

From within PCBSetup, you can edit the normal display file and the graphics 
specific version by using F2 and F3 respectively.  If you edit a file, 
PCBSetup is going to call the text and graphics editors that you defined in 
System Manager | Define Text & Graphics Editors because these are text 
display files.

Name/Loc of WELCOME File

This file will be displayed after the Do you want graphics prompt is answered 
(assuming Q is not used to abort the welcome file).  Typically, SysOps will 
design this screen to display the system name, phone numbers, and any other 
relative facts.

Name/Loc of NEWUSER File

When a new user is logging into your system, this display file will be shown 
to them right after they confirm that they are a new user.  In this file you 
will most likely want to display rules of your system and any steps that the 
user must complete to become registered on your system.

Name/Loc of CLOSED File

This file is displayed whenever PCBoard determines that a user cannot login 
to a system because it is a closed system.  There are two ways of creating a 
closed system:

In PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control you have enabled the Run 
System as a Closed Board option.    New users will not be allowed to login to 
the system.

The security level of the caller has been defined to have 0 minutes available 
in the PWRD file.  This will display the CLOSED file regardless of the closed 
board option in PCBSetup.

You will want to display a brief explanation of why the user cannot login to 
your system and provide further instructions as to what the user should do.

Name/Loc of WARNING File

The WARNING file is displayed only to those callers whose subscription is 
about to expire.  This file will be displayed whenever the user is within the 
warning period defined in PCBSetup | Subscriptions.  You will want to let the 
user know that their subscription is about to expire.  You may want to 
purposely use color or other eye-catching effects to make this file stand out 
since some of your users may miss this file.

Name/Loc of EXPIRED File

When a user's subscription has expired, PCBoard will display the EXPIRED file 
every time they login.  Therefore, you may want to have this file contain the 
instructions necessary for a user to renew their subscription.

Name/Loc of Conference Join Menu

When a user executes the J user command with out specifying a conference name 
or number to join, PCBoard will display the menu of conferences that are 
available.  The display file defined by this file is the one that is used to 
list the conferences that are available on your system.  Because it is a text 
file, you can customize it to look any way that you desire.  You should 
include the conference number and/or name for each conference so the user may 
use the name or number of the conference they wish to join.

Name/Loc of Group Chat Intro File

When a user joins group chat, this file will be displayed to them.  In this 
file you may want to outline general rules of courtesy in regards to node 
chat.  Remember that this file will be displayed every time group chat is 
joined so you may not want to make this file particularly long.

Name/Loc of Group Chat Menu

While in group chat, the user can execute several different
commands.  These commands allow the user to change channels,
send private messages to other users, and more.  This display
file is a menu that is displayed when a user is not in expert
mode and presses ESC.  Expert users would need to ask for the menu
by typing MENU at the Chat Command prompt.

Name/Loc of NOANSI Warning

Group chat makes heavy use of the ANSI terminal emulation standard.  If 
PCBoard determines that the user is not capable of ANSI at login and the user 
attempts to join group chat, this file will be displayed.  In this file, you 
may simply want to warn the user that they should instruct their terminal 
program to use split-screen chat mode (if available) or avoid typing while 
others are typing.

New User/Logon/off Questionnaires

Besides normal script questionnaires, you can also use script questionnaires 
at logon, logoff, and when a new user is logging into the system.  As with 
normal script questionnaires, you can use the text format questionnaires or 
you can make the questionnaire files actual PPE files if you need more 
control when asking questions.

Name/Loc of New Reg Questionnaire

When a new user logs into your system, this questionnaires gives
you the ability to ask for additional information that PCBoard
does not.  For example, you may want to ask questions about
where the new user found out about your system or even something
like their birth date.

If you have defined a new registration questionnaire, it will be used right 
after PCBoard finishes asking it's normal questions (default protocol, 
password, etc.)

Name/Loc of Answers to New Reg.

The filename that you specify in this field is where the answers to the new 
registration questionnaire will be stored.  If you used a standard script 
questionnaire, the answer file will simply print the question that was asked 
followed by the answer that the user gave.  If you are using a PPE for the 
new registration questionnaire, the format of the answers could be in any 
format since the PPE controls the output.

Name/Loc of Login Script Quest.

The login script questionnaire is executed by everyone right after they enter 
their password and even before the $$LOGON.BAT file is executed.  If you want 
to ask a questionnaire for every login or more likely to execute a PPE at 
every login, define the file to use as your questionnaire.

NOTE:  You can also have this field display an additional logon
screen by specifying the filename to display in this field and leaving the 
answer field blank.  When the answer field is blank, no questions will be 
asked.

Name/Loc of Logon Script Answers

The filename that you specify in this field is where the answers to the logon 
questionnaire will be stored.  If you used a standard script questionnaire, 
the answer file will simply print the question that was asked followed by the 
answer that the user gave.  If you are using a PPE for the logon 
questionnaire, the format of the answers could be in any format since the PPE 
controls the output.

Name/Loc of Logoff Script Quest.

The logoff script questionnaire is executed by everyone right after they 
enter the command to logoff and before the $$LOGOFF.BAT file is executed.  If 
you want to ask a questionnaire at every logoff or more likely to execute a 
PPE at every login, define the file to use as your questionnaire.

NOTE:  You can also have this field display a logoff screen by specifying the 
filename to display in this field and leaving the answer field blank.  When 
the answer field is blank, no questions will be asked.

Name/Loc of Logoff Script Answers

The filename that you specify in this field is where the answers to the 
logoff questionnaire will be stored.  If you used a standard script 
questionnaire, the answer file will simply print the question that was asked 
followed by the answer that the user gave.  If you are using a PPE for the 
logoff questionnaire, the format of the answers could be in any format since 
the PPE controls the output.

Modem Information

Selecting this menu option allows you to modify the setup of PCBoard in 
regards to the serial port you are using.  Not only can you define the serial 
port you will be using, but there are options which control the behavior of 
PCBoard with your serial port.

There are three menu options that you can select.  If you want to configure 
what serial port to use, the initialization string, or other items related to 
the setup of your modem then you should select the first menu option.  
Selecting the second menu option will allow you to set numerous options that 
control how PCBoard interacts with your modem.  Finally, the last menu option 
contains items that allow you to control access to the node you are 
configuring based on the connect speed of the caller.

When you installed PCBoard, the install program configured your modem with a 
program named PCBMODEM.EXE.  This utility will configure numerous modems to 
operate properly with PCBoard.  You should run PCBModem at least once to 
configure your modem properly.


Modem Setup

Seconds to wait for carrier

As soon as PCBoard detects a ring coming in from the modem, it will countdown 
from the number that you enter in this field to 0.  If PCBoard reaches 0 
without being able to determine that a connection has been established, it 
will recycle and wait for the next call.  Normally a good value to set for 
this field is between 30 and 45 seconds to catch all connections.

Comm Driver to use (A/C/F)

Standard PCBoard software supplies only one type of comm driver and that is 
Asynchronous.  If you have the standard PCBoard software, you should enter A 
in this field.  If you attempt to enter any other answer, PCBoard will not 
operate properly.

If you have the multiport version of PCBoard (sometimes referred to as the /M 
version), you can select any of the comm drivers to use.  The following 
describes each comm driver:

        A       Asynchronous (Async).  Select this option if you wish to use 
                standard serial ports (sometimes referred to as COM ports). 
                These serial ports all utilize standard UART chips (e.g., 
                8250, 16450, 16550, etc.).  With this driver PCBoard requires 
                that each serial port in the machine access a unique base 
                address and IRQ setting.

        C       COMM-DRV.  The multiport version of PCBoard includes a TSR 
                that is called COMM-DRV.  This TSR provides a standard 
                interface between numerous serial devices.  Not only are 
                intelligent serial boards like those produced by Arnet and 
                Digiboard supported but also some non-intelligent serial 
                boards are supported.  To confirm whether or not your card 
                will work with the multiport driver, refer to the Preparing 
                The Multiport Driver section in the Multiple Nodes chapter of 
                this manual, or contact technical support.

        F       FOSSIL.  PCBoard can also communicate with serial devices 
                that provide a FOSSIL interface.  Usually this requires that 
                you load a device driver or TSR program.

Comm Port (0=NONE/Local Only)

Enter the number of the comm port to be used by PCBoard.  If you enter a comm 
port of 0, no modem will be used by PCBoard and local logins will be used for 
all calls.

If you have configured PCBoard to use the async comm driver, the numbers 1 
and 2 correspond to COM1 and COM2 in your machine. Any number higher than 2 
will require that you supply a base address and IRQ value to define the port.  
If you enter a port higher than 2, your hardware must be configured for 
whatever values you enter for the base address and IRQ.  If they do not, 
PCBoard will either refuse to load, or will not be able to properly 
communicate with your comm port.  Refer to the Troubleshooting section of the 
PCBoard chapter for additional details.

If you have configured PCBoard to use COMM-DRV, enter the corresponding port 
number that you defined in DRVSETUP.  For example, if you want to use the 
port 2 defined in this sample DRVSETUP

 Port         Card   Sub-    Base           Card
Number        Type   Port   Address  IRQ   Segment  FOSSIL
------       ------  ----   -------  ---   -------  ------
   1         ARNET     1      300      3    D000       Y
   2         ARNET     2      300      3    D000       Y

enter 2 in the comm port field because that is what is defined as the port 
number in DRVSETUP.

If you selected the FOSSIL comm driver instead, enter the port number as it 
is defined in your external communications driver that provides the FOSSIL 
interface.

Opening Baud Rate (300-115200)

In this field, enter the speed you wish for PCBoard to initially open your 
serial port.  Normally you will want to set this to the maximum port rate 
speed that your modem supports.  The valid options are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 
9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

Sometimes, your modem may be able to support a faster port rate speed then 
your serial and computer hardware may be able to keep up with.  If this is 
the case, you will experience data loss (some bytes will be lost when 
transferred).  To resolve this, you can lower the opening port rate speed or 
upgrade your computer hardware.

NOTE:  If you enter an opening port rate speed of 19200 or higher, PCBoard 
will force the port speed to be locked regardless of how you have set the 
Lock in Opening Baud Rate.

Lock in Opening Baud Rate

A locked port speed tells the modem to communicate at the rate you entered 
for the opening port speed.  When the communications port is not locked, 
PCBoard will always communicate at the same speed as the caller is connected 
at.

A locked port rate will have no effect unless you are using a modem that is 
capable of error-correction (e.g., V.42, MNP) and an error-correction 
connection is established.  With an error-correcting connection, the actual 
throughput of all data transferred can be increased by up to 20% because the 
start and stop bits are stripped out.  In addition, most error-correcting 
modems also support data compression of ASCII text (such as display screens) 
very well.

If you enable this option, you need to be sure that your modem is also 
configured to expect a locked port rate (sometimes referred as a fixed DTE 
speed or a fixed DTE link).  If both the software and hardware are not 
configured to communicate at a locked port rate, you will see garbage 
characters on the remote screen when calling in.

Modem Initialization String

This field contains the initializing string that PCBoard should send to the 
modem when it first loads and whenever it recycles to the call-waiting 
screen.  The string that you enter in this field will vary between modems 
because most modems have different command sets and default values.  The best 
thing to do is to use PCBModem to properly configure your modem for use with 
PCBoard.  Instructions for PCBModem can be found in the Utilities chapter of 
this manual.  If your modem is not listed in PCBModem, contact the technical 
support staff  to get your modem configured properly with PCBoard.

There are two special characters that you can use in your initialization 
string to simulate a carriage return (pressing R) and to incorporate a brief 
pause in your initialization string.

        ^M      If you enter these two characters in your initialization 
                string, PCBoard will send a carriage return and continue 
                sending the rest of the initialization string.  Some modems 
                have a problem with long initialization strings.  Use the 
                carriage returns to break up a long initialization string.  
                For example

                   ATM0^MATH0^MATS0=0


                would send the following to your modem:


                   ATM0 ENTER
                   ATH0 ENTER
                   ATS0=0 

        
        ~       If you enter this character in your initialization string, 
                PCBoard will pause 1/2 of one second every time it encounters 
                this character.  This would be useful to manually slow down 
                the speed at which the modem initialization string is sent.

If you run communications programs on the same modem that you use for your 
system, you need to be careful to restore the modem to all of the proper 
settings because your communications program has an initialization string as 
well.  One initialization string that you could use would be ATZ^MATM0H0. 
This string will reset the modem, turn off the speaker, and put the phone 
line back on hook (if it was off hook).  Be forewarned, however, that some 
modems have a problem with sending ATZ in the initialization string and may 
report a modem reset error.

An incorrect initialization string that does not generate an OK from the 
modem will result in PCBoard issuing a modem reset error.  If you experience 
this error, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the PCBoard chapter of 
this manual for additional instructions.

Modem Off-Hook String

Sometimes PCBoard will want to take the phone off-hook to make the phone line 
busy.  PCBoard will send the off-hook string that you enter in this field at 
the following times:

Selecting User - Busy, Sysop - Busy, or DOS-Busy from the call waiting 
screen.

Enabling the Modem Off-Hook During Recycle will force the phone to be 
off-hook from the time carrier is dropped until the initialization string is 
sent.

Recycling the node using the 15 sysop command.


NOTE:  Some modems have built in limits as to how long they will stay 
off-hook.  When this time expires, they will go back on hook (allowing your 
phone to ring).  In this type of situation there is nothing that PCBoard can 
do to keep the phone line busy as this is a built in function of the modem.

Configuration Switches

Disable CTS/RTS Checking

CTS/RTS refers to a type of flow control called hardware flow control which 
restricts or enables the flow of data.  When data cannot be received or sent 
by one side of the connection it will attempt to restrict the flow of data 
via the hardware flow control signals provided by the RS-232 serial 
interface.  In other words, flow control is necessary to guarantee that modem 
and computer buffers are not caused to overflow by incoming or outgoing data.

Normally you will want to answer N to this question unless your modem or 
serial card does not support CTS/RTS flow control.  For high speed 
communications it is essential that you do not disable flow control or you 
risk losing data over the connection.

NOTE:  For high speed communications it is essential that you answer N to 
this question or risk data loss over the modem.

Valid options for this field are:

      N         CTS/RTS flow control will be enabled by PCBoard.  Similar to 
                locking the port rate, it is required that both the modem and 
                PCBoard be configured to use CTS/RTS flow control.  It is 
                also important that your modem not be configured for XON/XOFF 
                or software flow control.

      Y         Hardware (CTS/RTS) flow control will be disabled by PCBoard. 
                Select this setting only if your modem does not support 
                hardware flow control (check your modem manual if you are 
                unsure).

Disable RTS-Drop During Write

While PCBoard is receiving an upload file (via an internal transfer protocol) 
it will normally shut down the RTS signal while it writes to disk to avoid 
data loss.


      N         When writing data being uploaded, PCBoard will shut down RTS 
                to prevent data from being lost.

      Y         Disables this automatic RTS shut down.  While faster uploads 
                may be possible, it could result in data loss.  You would be 
                most likely to experience data loss if the upload is being 
                written to a slow drive or across the network..

Using a FastComm 9600

If you are using a FastComm 9600 modem, you should answer Y in this field.  
PCBoard has to assume certain aspects about the connection due to the way the 
FastComm modem operates.  If you are not using a FastComm 9600 modem, leave 
this field set to N.

Reset Modem While Idle

PCBoard gives you the opportunity to reinitialize the serial port and modems 
every five minutes while idling at the call waiting screen.  This may be 
beneficial if you experience unexplained modem reset errors.  Valid options 
are:

      N         When at the call waiting screen, PCBoard makes no attempt to 
                reinitialize the port.

      Y         While at the call waiting screen, the port and modem will be 
                reinitialized after five minutes of inactivity.


NOTE:  In some modems this can help keep the modem from getting modem reset 
errors while other modems will instead be more prone to such errors.  
Experiment with this setting if you are getting modem reset errors during 
recycles.

Reset Modem During Recycle

After a caller hangs up you can automatically have PCBoard send the standard 
ATZ to your modem to initialize the power-on defaults of your modem.  This 
might  be useful if your modem experiences unexplained modem reset errors.  
Valid options for this field are:

      N         After a caller is disconnected, PCBoard will not send the ATZ 
                command to your modem.

      Y         After a caller disconnects from your system, PCBoard will 
                send an ATZ command to restore the power-on defaults of your 
                modem.

NOTE:  In some modems this can help keep the modem from getting modem reset 
errors while other modems will instead be more prone to such errors.  
Experiment with this setting if you are getting modem reset errors during 
recycles.

Modem Off-Hook During Recycle

Normally after PCBoard disconnects a caller, it will leave the phone on-hook.  
Those callers calling in will get a ring.  This is usually desirable because 
PCBoard recycles very quickly under normal circumstances.  At most, callers 
may get two to three rings before the modem answers the phone.  If you wish, 
you can configure PCBoard to make the phone busy until it is ready for the 
next caller.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will leave the phone on-hook (incoming callers will 
                hear rings).

      Y         The phone will be taken off-hook causing incoming callers to 
                get busy signals until after PCBoard has completely recycled 
                and is waiting for the next call.

NOTE:  In some modems this can help keep the modem from getting modem reset 
errors while other modems will instead be more prone to such errors.  
Experiment with this setting if you are getting errors during recycles.

Modem Delay During Recycle

Some modems can get confused if you attempt to recycle the system too quickly 
resulting in modem reset errors.  Setting a value of 1 or higher can help 
slow down the recycle process and give your modem more time to be reset 
without experiencing a modem reset error.

In addition, this value can be used to 'tune' the speed with which PCBoard 
recycles.  On buffered modems, a higher setting will insure that all data 
gets transmitted.  If your remote callers are not receiving all of the 
information before carrier is dropped, try increasing the value entered in 
this field.

Packet-Switch Network

If you are running in any kind of environment where PCBoard is directly 
connected to a cable and not directly connected to a modem (e.g., a PAD, 
packet-switch network, X.25) you need to inform PCBoard via this field.  
Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard operates in a normal manner expecting a modem to be 
                directly connected to the serial port you specify.

      Y         PCBoard will assume that the modem is not directly connected 
                to the serial port specified.  PCBoard will not send an 
                initialization string when recycling after a call (or at 
                startup).  PCBoard will know that a call needs to be attended 
                to when a ENTER is sent over the connection.  You should also 
                use this setting if you are using a null-modem cable to 
                connect with another machine.

NOTE:  It is important that the CTS/RTS, RD/SD and CD/DTR signals be wired 
properly if you select Y for this field.  

Verify CD-Loss

When the Carrier Detect (CD) signal goes out, it generally indicates that the 
connection has been broken and that the caller has disconnected.  However, 
some modems will drop the CD signal while auto-bauding (changing baud rates) 
in search of a more efficient speed.  This is generally caused by changing 
line noise conditions.  Valid options for this field are:

      N         When the CD signal goes out, PCBoard will assume the caller 
                has hung-up and will recycle the system.  In a PAD or 
                packet-switching environment loss of the carrier detect 
                signal never indicates auto-bauding.  In fact, a PAD will 
                often bring the CD signal right back up.  To avoid 
                accidentally putting the next caller into the last caller's 
                session, select this option.

      Y         To avoid detecting CD loss when, in fact, the caller is still 
                on-line, you must answer Y.  When the CD signal goes out, 
                PCBoard will verify that the modem is not simply compensating 
                for line noise.  This will avoid PCBoard automatically 
                thinking that a caller has hung up when the CD signal goes 
                out.

Leave DTR Up at Drop to DOS

When selecting the DOS - Not Busy button on the call waiting
screen, this option controls whether the DTR signal is left on
or not.  Valid option are:

      N         The DTR signal will be turned off.
      
      Y         The DTR signal will be left on.


Answer on True Ring Detect

Normally, PCBoard waits for RING to be sent from the modem and then sends ATA 
to the modem to answer the phone.  This proves to be the most reliable method 
for answering the phone.  If you desire, you can choose to have PCBoard watch 
the ring detect line as signaled by the serial card.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will use the more reliable method of waiting for the 
                RING to come from the modem before attempting to answer the 
                phone.

      Y         PCBoard will answer on a true ring detect as signaled by the 
                serial card.  You should only enable this option for those 
                modems which do not return the verbose RING response when the 
                phone is ringing.


Number of Rings Required

This setting allows you to customize the number of times you want the phone 
to ring before PCBoard tells the modem to pick it up.

For example, you may be in an environment where the phone is normally used 
for voice calls but at night you want to be able to dial into the system.  By 
setting this value a high number most voice callers will hang up before 
PCBoard answers the phone.

NOTE:  For CallerID detection to work, you must set this number to at least 2 
since CallerID is passed in between the 1st and 2nd ring.

Monitor Missed Connections

After an incoming phone call is detected, there are four possible outcomes.  
They are:

The countdown will run to completion without establishing a connection (no 
handshaking, or handshaking failed to complete)

A NO CARRIER message will be issued by the modem before the connection is 
ever completed (aborted handshaking sequence)

A connection will be established but carrier is lost before the caller logs 
into the system

A connection is established and the caller successfully logs into the system


Valid options for this field are:


      N         Only those connections which are fully established will be 
                written to the caller log.

      Y         Normally PCBoard only writes successful login information out 
                to the caller log.  Selecting this option will instruct 
                PCBoard to write one of three lines corresponding to the 
                first three possible outcomes listed previously.

1.   NO CONNECT / FULL COUNTDOWN
2.   NO CONNECT / NO CARRIER
3.   Carrier Lost


Force NON-16550 Usage

Some of the early 16550 UART chips are buggy.  The bug is most often seen 
when data output gets behind where it should be and only proceeds when typing 
more characters.  If the command prompt is incomplete, but gradually, one 
character at a time, becomes more complete as you type a command, then you 
likely have one of the buggy 16550 UARTs.  Valid options for this field are:

Setting Force NON-16550A Usage to N will generally make the problem go away, 
but you lose access to the FIFO buffers.  A better solution is to replace the 
defective UART chip.

      N         PCBoard will not modify the way that it treats the UART it 
                detects.

      Y         Even if PCBoard detects a 16550 UART, it will treat it as if 
                it was a 16450 UART.  If you suspect that some of the 
                advanced features of your 16550 UART are defective, you may 
                want to select this option.

Force 16550A Usage

Some multi-tasking environments, such as OS/2 or Windows, use device drivers 
to virtualize the comm port.  In the process of doing so, they may hide the 
16550A UART, making it appear to be a 16450 UART when accessed by a DOS 
application.  Valid options for this field are:

      N         PCBoard will assume the UART it detects is the real UART you 
                have installed.

      Y         This option forces PCBoard to operate as if a 16550A UART was 
                detected.  This enables the use of FIFO buffers for both 
                transmit and receive operations.  Do not set this option to Y 
                if you do not have a 16550A UART.

Share IRQs on MCA Buses

PS/2s and other Micro Channel based machines have the ability to share 
interrupts among different hardware devices.  This setting will not work 
unless the IRQ is being shared with software that is loaded before the 
multitasker.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will operate in normal asynchronous mode where it 
                expects each port to have a unique IRQ for each port.

      Y         PCBoard will  try to share the interrupt that is used by the 
                serial port.

NOTE:  Sharing interrupts slows down processing.  Therefore, it is 
recommended that you only use this option when necessary.

Allowed Access Speeds

Allow Callers at 7,E,1

The majority of PC communications will communicate at 8,N,1 which refers to 8 
data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit. However, some of your callers may use 
the less frequently used 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit (7,E,1).

      N         Callers who call in using 7,E,1 will be refused access to 
                your system.

      Y         Callers may connect with your system using 8,N,1 or 7,E,1. Be 
                aware that if a caller connects using  7,E,1 then file 
                transfers will be disabled for that session.  This is done 
                because 7,E,1 does not have the capability of properly 
                transferring binary data.

Lowest Desired Baud

You can set a minimum speed that a caller must have to log into your system.  
For example, if you want to let only users who have are able to connect at 
1200 or higher then you would enter 1200 in  this field.  The next three 
fields on this screen determine if you will allow slower speeds and if so, at 
what time during the day lower connection speeds will be allowed.

Allow Lower Speeds

Sometimes you may want to allow callers to connect at a slower speed than the 
one entered in the Lowest Desired Baud field. PCBoard will give you the 
ability to let users connect at a slower speed but only during a specific 
time during the day.

      N         Users must connect at a speed equal to or greater than the 
                value that you enter in the Lowest Desired Baud field.   If a 
                caller  attempts to connect at a slower speed a message 
                notifying the user that the connection speed is not supported 
                on your system will be displayed.

      Y         Users may connect at a slower speed than the value that you 
                enter in the Lowest Desired Baud field.  However, the connect 
                must be made during the time range that you define with the 
                Begin Time and End Time field on this screen.

Begin Time

In this field you can specify the beginning time (hhmm format) when users can 
call in at a slower speed then what is defined by the Lowest Desired Baud 
field.  All times you enter must be done in 24 hour format.  If you answered 
N to the Allow Lower Speeds, the starting and ending times are ignored.

End Time

In this field you can specify the ending time (hhmm format) when users can 
call in at a slower speed then what is defined by the Lowest Desired Baud 
field.  All times you enter must be done in 24 hour format.  If you answered 
N to the Allow Lower Speeds, the starting and ending times are ignored.

Security Level Override

If you enter any security level other than 0 in this field, users that have 
an equal or greater than security level will be able to login to the system 
regardless of the time of the login. The security level override is valid 
regardless of the Allow Lower setting.

Node Configuration

Board Name

In this field, enter here the name of your bulletin board system.  This name 
is shown to the caller at connect time together with the PCBoard copyright 
notice.  In addition, it is displayed when someone uses the I user command 
and at the top of the call waiting screen.  You can enter up to 63 characters 
to identify your bulletin board system in this field.

Origin

This field is reserved primarily for use with netmail networks to identify 
your system.  The format of the information you enter here depends on the 
netmail software you are using and the netmail system you are connecting to.  
Contact the netmail software authors and/or your netmail system administrator 
for details.

Parallel Port Num (1-3,0)

There are a few places within PCBoard where you can send output to the 
printer.  For example, you can press ALT-P while a user is on-line to start 
capturing the text on the screen to the printer.  Likewise, you can toggle 
printing of the caller logs from the call waiting screen.  All of these 
functions need to know what LPT port to send the output to.  In this field, 
enter the LPT port you want PCBoard to send printout to.  Valid entries are 
0-3.  If you enter a value of 0, no printer output will be sent.

Running a Network / Multitasker System

If you are running more than one node on your system, you need to let PCBoard 
know so that it may use the proper file sharing routines and otherwise take 
care of other multiple node concerns.

      N         PCBoard will allow a single node to operate.  No file sharing 
                will be used and many of the user and sysop commands relating 
                to multiple nodes will be disabled.

      Y         PCBoard will enable file and record sharing so that multiple 
                nodes can access system files at the same time.  PCBoard uses 
                the DOS standard for file sharing.  If you enable this 
                option, make sure that you have either load SHARE.EXE in your 
                AUTOEXEC.BAT, or that your multitasker/network provide the 
                sharing functions that are completely compatible with 
                SHARE.EXE.

If you have told PCBoard that you wish to run more than one node, you will 
need to assign each node a unique node number. You enter the node number in 
the Node Number on the Network field.

Node Number on the Network

In this field, enter the node number you wish to assign for the node you are 
configuring with PCBSetup.  Node numbers must be from 1 to the highest number 
supported by the software you have purchased.  Numbers higher then that will 
default back to 1 by PCBoard.

If you answered N to the Running a Network question,  the answer to this 
question will be ignored.

Float Node Number

The ability to float node numbers is a feature designed for enabling a large 
group of local network users to login to a limited amount of PCBoard nodes.  
What makes this feature even more desirable is that you can mix these local 
nodes with your dial-in nodes (if you have any).

When this option is enabled, PCBoard will start looking for a free node 
number in your system starting with the node number you defined earlier on 
this screen.  If a node is found, the user will be logged in, using the free 
node number.  If no free nodes can be found, a message is printed to the user 
stating that no nodes are available and that they should try again in a few 
minutes.

The setup for floating nodes is more complicated than simply enabling a 
switch in PCBSetup.  You will need to modify some of your batch files and 
other system files to make it work properly.  For additional information on 
setting up float nodes, see the Networking section in the Multiple Nodes 
chapter of this manual.

Valid options for this field are:

      N         Node numbers will not be floated.  You will want to use this 
                switch for your dial-in nodes since you most likely want 
                their node numbers to remain fixed.

      Y         Node numbers will be floated.  As mentioned previously, this 
                is most useful when you are operating in a local environment 
                where several callers are trying to get into a few single 
                nodes logging in across a network.

Network Timeout on Errors (20-99 secs)

This is the number of seconds that PCBoard should wait after it has detected 
a network time-out before failing the operation. You can enter any value 
between 20 and 99 seconds.

In other words, it is common for resources on a network to be in use at the 
time that another user wants to use the same resource.  This is normal and 
should be allowed.  You should set this value depending on the size and speed 
of your system.  The bigger and slower the network is, the longer the network 
time-out delay might need to be.

Node Chat Frequency (once every 5-99 secs)

In this field, enter the number of seconds that PCBoard should wait in 
between each checking of the USERNET.XXX file.  This file is used for node 
chat requests, broadcasts, drop to DOS commands, mail waiting notices, etc.

The lower the number the less delay there will be after an action is 
requested.  However, a low number also increases traffic on the network or 
multinode system and can slow it down.

Include City Field in WHO Display

When the WHO user command is used in PCBoard, a display of the users that are 
currently logged onto the system is shown. Depending on how sensitive the 
city/location information is to your callers you may choose to show the 
city/location information of each users from the WHO display.

      N         Only the node number and the user currently logged in will be 
                displayed in a WHO display.  

      Y         The WHO display will include the city/location field of each 
                of the users currently online.

Show ALIAS Names in WHO Display

For some systems it may not be desirable to display the alias names in the 
who display even though aliases are allowed.  For example, a public system 
with an adult section might allow adult oriented aliases in the adult 
conference, but displaying those names in a public WHO display might not be 
desirable.

Other systems, which are either not adult oriented or are not open to the 
public, may not experience this situation in which case showing the alias 
might be preferred.  Valid responses for this field are:

Remember:  You must install the Alias PSA for PCBoard to allow alias names on 
your system.

      N         Always display the real name of the caller in the WHO display 
                even if their alias is current active.  If you have only 
                certain areas that allow aliases it might look funny if you 
                have a user named JIM SMITH on one node and CAPTAIN HOOK on 
                another.

      Y         When the user's alias is active, show their alias in the WHO 
                display.


Using Slave Cards (slows file access)

Answer Y to this question if you have an Alloy Slave system and
are running NTNX prior to version 2.0.


NOTE:  This option will slow down access to some files.

Event Setup

An event is simply a batch file that gets executed during a
specific time of the day.  In this event batch file you could do
some of the following things:


* Pack your users and/or message bases
* If you are part of a mail network, you will most likely transfer mail packets
* Some third party products you use on your bulletin board may need to run 
  utilities to update data bases, etc.
* Create a list of files on your 
  system using PCBFiler and the /LIST parameter.
* Backup your system


The previous examples are but only a few of the things you can do in your 
event.  Since events simply execute batch files you are more or less limited 
by your imagination as far as what you want to run in your event.

To define your event information you need to select Event Setup from Main 
Menu of PCBSetup.  When you select this option, you will see the following 
screen:

Is a Timed Event Active

Enter a Y in this field if you want to run the events that you have defined 
in your EVENT.DAT file.  If you wish to disable running events, enter an N in 
this field instead.

Name / Location of EVENT.DAT

The EVENT.DAT file holds all of the information that defines the timed events 
on your system.  To edit/define the events that you will run on your system, 
you need to edit your EVENT.DAT file. By pressing F2 while the Name / 
Location of EVENT.DAT field is highlighted, the editor for your EVENT.DAT 
will be loaded  Your screen should now resemble the following:

This is known as the event editor.  There are several fields that you can 
edit which control the batch file that will get run for an event and the 
times when you event will be run.  

The number to the left of each line is the event number that is being 
defined.  The rest of the fields on the screen are as follows:

Act             You may enter either a Y or an N in this field.  A Y 
                signifies that the event is active and should be executed as 
                configured.  If you enter an N, the event will be considered 
                inactive and will not be run as defined. 

Mod             The mode of the event.  You may enter either an E or an S in 
                this field.  If you enter an E then the event is an expedited 
                or non-sliding event.  If you enter an S as the event type, 
                the event is referred to as a sliding event which will run 
                the next time the node returns to the call waiting screen 
                after the event time.

                If an event is an expedited or non-sliding event, PCBoard 
                will make its best attempt to execute the event at the time 
                you specify as the beginning time even if it means cutting 
                user's time short.

Batch File      In this field, you need to specify the batch file you wish to 
                execute for the event being defined.  You are given 8 
                characters for the batch filename.  The reason for this is 
                that by default this batch file will be run on all nodes.  
                However, you can make node specific batch files by making the 
                node number the filename extension.  For example, if you 
                entered a batch file of DAILY and you wanted node 5 to 
                execute a different batch file then you would create a 
                DAILY.005 file in the same directory where the DAILY file is 
                located.

Begin Time      This is the earliest time that your event will be run.  The 
                time that you enter in this field must be in 24 hour format 
                and there must be a colon between the hour and minutes.

End Time        The end time is the latest possible time that you wish for 
                the event to run.  If the event has not run by the time you 
                enter, the event will be skipped.

Days            You may also control which days that the event you are 
                defining is run on.  In this field all seven days of the week 
                are listed beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday. 
                Simply enter either a Y or N which signifies whether you want 
                to run the event on the day listed or not.

Date            This field enables you to specify the dates that PCBoard will 
                run the event.  Entering a 00 signifies a wildcard.  For 
                example, if you want the event to run on the first day of 
                every month, then you would enter a date of 00-01-00.  This 
                event would run on the first day of any month of any year.  
                Another example would be to set the date to 01-01-00.  This 
                event would run the first day of every year.

Last Date       Contains the date that the event was last run on the node 
                number that is specified in PCBSetup | Node Configuration. 
                Not all events run system- wide therefore this field only 
                contains the last date ran for the node you are currently 
                editing.

While you are in the event editor, the following keyboard commands are 
available to you:

      E         Exit the event editor.  When you are finished editing your
                event data file, use this keyboard command to exit the editor. 
If any changes to the file have been detected, you will be asked
if you wish to save the changes.

      F1        Access on-line help.  If you use this keyboard command,
on-line help relating to the field that is highlighted is
displayed to you.

      F2        Edit the event batch file(s).  When the Batch File field is
                highlighted, this keyboard command will use the text editor
defined in System Manager to edit your event batch file(s).  If
you have more than one batch file for the event (node specific
events), a selection box will pop up enabling you to pick the
event batch file that you wish to edit.

      PgDn      View the next 15 entries.  On each screen of the event
editor, 15 entries can be displayed.  If you want to view the
next 15 entries in the file, use this keyboard command.

      PgUp      View the previous 15 entries.  To view the previous 15
entries of the event data file, use this keyboard command.

      ALT-I     Insert a new line.  If you need to add a new entry between
         two existing entries, use this keyboard command.  A new blank
entry will be inserted just below the current line.

      ALT-D     Delete current line.  This keyboard command will delete the
currently highlighted entry.  There is no undo function to get
the original line back.  If you make a mistake, exit without
saving and attempt to make the changes again.

      ALT-R     Repeat current line.  If you are creating entries that are
very similar  in definition, you can use this keyboard command
to duplicate the currently highlighted entry.  The new entry
will be inserted just below the current line.

The Events section in the SysOp's Guide chapter of this manual
contains a more thorough discussion of events and how to define
them for your system.

       Location for multiple nodes
 
       Because the event data file stores information about each node, it is 
       required that all nodes access the same data file.  If all nodes do 
       not use the same file, your events may not run reliably.

Location of EVENT Files

This field stores the location where your event batch files will be located.  
When an event runs, it will look for the event batch file to be located in 
the subdirectory that you specify.

      Location for multiple nodes

      You should insure that all nodes in your system point to the same 
      location for event files.  The event system was designed to store the 
      batch files in one physical location.  If the nodes on your system all 
      point to different locations, your events will not operate properly.


Minutes Prior to Suspend All Activity

If an event is defined as an expedited event, you can define the number of 
minutes prior to the event time that all activity on the system will cease.  
If your event is defined to run at 2:00am and you configure PCBoard for a 15 
minute suspense time, PCBoard will attempt to insure that every user has 
logged off by 1:45am.

The suspense time is used as a safety zone to make sure all
users that are in doors or other applications outside of PCBoard's control 
will return to the system in time for the event.  Another reason why you may 
want to suspend activity prior to the event actually running is to let any 
file transfers finish.  Even though PCBoard will make its best estimate in 
regards to how long it will take to download files, sometimes line noise or 
other line conditions will extend the time of the transfer.  By suspending 
activity prior to the event actually running, you can help insure that all of 
your expedited events will run on time.

During the suspense time, the phone is taken off-hook and a message is 
printed at the top of the screen to let you know that PCBoard is waiting for 
the event time.  During this time, the phone will be busy to all callers that 
attempt to call.

Disallow Uploads Prior to Event

This field is used primarily to try to guarantee that the system will be able 
to run an expedited event at the time you have defined.  When downloading 
files, PCBoard knows how many bytes will be downloaded and approximately how 
long it will take for the transfer to take place.  When a user uploads a 
file, PCBoard does not know how big the upload will be or even if it will 
consist of multiple files (batch protocols only).  Because of this unknown 
factor, you may want to restrict uploads before an expedited event runs.  
Valid options for this field are:

      N         Do not make any special restrictions in regards to uploading 
                files prior to an event.  If the user has any time left on 
                the system, they may begin an upload.  This could mean that a 
                user could begin an upload just before they are forced off 
                (because they still have time available).  Because no 
                restrictions are made on uploads, they could overrun your 
                suspense time and even your normally scheduled event time.  
                Normally when you use this setting you would want to have a 
                substantial suspense time to help compensate for large 
                uploads.

      Y         Disable uploads prior to a schedule event.  The value that 
                you enter in the Minutes Prior to Disallow Uploads field will 
                determine when uploads will be disabled if you choose to 
                disable them before an event.

Minutes Prior to Disallow Uploads

For this field to have any meaning you must have chosen to disallow uploads 
prior to an event.  In this field enter the number of minutes prior to the 
event running that you wish to disallow uploads.  You can enter any value 
between 0 and 99 in this field.  If you enter 0 in this field, uploads will 
be disabled anytime the user's time limit is adjusted for an upcoming event.

Subscription

When you have enabled subscription mode, you can control the security level 
and conference access of each user based expiration date entered in the user 
record.  When a user logs into the system on or after their expiration date, 
they are considered to be expired.  PCBoard will then assign the user the 
security level entered in the expired security level of their record.  This 
security change will be in effect until the user is no longer expired.  In 
addition, the user will be denied access to any conference that they do not 
have the X conference registration flag set in.

By selecting Subscription from the Main Menu of PCBSetup you can choose to 
enable subscription mode.  If subscription mode is enabled, you can also 
modify some of the parameters that control how subscription mode will be 
handled.

Enable Subscription Mode

Subscription mode will make PCBoard look at the expiration date of each user 
to determine if their subscription has expired or not.  When the user's 
subscription is current, they are given their normal security level and are 
able to join any conference they are registered in.  When a user is expired, 
they are assigned their expired security level and may also have their 
conference access restricted.

This setting will determine whether or not subscription mode will be enabled.  
Valid options for this field are:

      N         Subscription mode is disabled.  The user's expiration date is 
                ignored even if the user would normally be expired.

      Y         Subscription mode is enabled meaning that PCBoard will check 
                the expiration date of all users when they logon.  The 
                security level and conference access of the user will be set 
                according to the user record (Expired Security Level and X 
                conference flags).

Default Subscription Length in Days

This field controls what the expiration date of new users will be.  The 
number of days entered in this field will be added to the current date to 
determine the expiration date of the new user.  If you enter a default length 
of 0, the expiration date of new users will be 00-00-00 which is a date that 
will never occur and therefore they will never expire.  In other words, a 
setting of 0 disables subscription mode for new users.

Default `Expired' Security Level

Just as you can set a default expiration date for new users, you can also 
choose the default expired security level for new users as well.  Simply 
enter the security level that you wish to assign to the new user when they 
expire.  Remember that a security level of 0 locks the user out of the 
system.

Warning Days Prior to Expiration

The value that you enter in this field will determine how many days a user 
will be warned before their subscription expires. PCBoard will display the 
WARNING file at login specified in PCBSetup | File Locations | Display Files 
during the warning period.  

Configuration Options

From the Configuration Options menu selection you can control the way PCBoard 
behaves in various circumstances.  There are options in fields that control 
file transfers, messages, and many other things.

Messages

Number of Highest Conference Desired

In this field enter the highest conference number you want to be able to 
define on your system.  PCBSetup will use the number entered in this field to 
determine the highest conference number you can define from the Conferences 
Main Menu Option in PCBSetup.

If you enter a value higher than 39 in this field, you may have to update 
your conference allocations from System Manager | Users Info File 
Maintenance.  Whenever you change the value in this field, you should load 
System Manager and see if you need to update your conference allocations.

If you are running multiple nodes make sure all nodes have the exact same 
value for this field.  If all nodes do not have the same value for this 
field, then it is quite possible one or more of your nodes will not load 
because the conference allocations would not be in sync for all nodes.

Maximum Lines in the Message Editor

This field gives you the ability to limit the total number of lines that a 
user may enter if they use PCBoard to enter their message.  This means that 
the limit you enter in this field will be enforced when a user uploads a REP 
packet using the QWK command or even if they upload the message into the 
message editor.  You can enter any value between 17 and  400.  

The value that you enter in this field can help control the length of 
messages that are entered by your users.  If your users are leaving 
excessively long messages then you may want to lower the maximum number of 
lines to help encourage your users to be more brief in their messages.

NOTE:  Any messages that are posted by software other than PCBoard (such as 
an off-line mail reading door) may not honor this limit.  Anytime that third 
party software adds a message to a message base it is up to the author of the 
program to honor the settings you have defined.

Message Capture - Maximum Messages

This setting allows you to control the maximum number of messages that can be 
captured into a message capture file or a QWK packet.

The reason for setting this value to something other than a maximum number 
would be to either, limit the length of time it takes the caller to download 
a set of messages, or to keep a message capture from filling up the disk 
(especially if a ram disk is specified for the location of temporary files).

Message Capture - Max Per Conference

This setting allows you to control the maximum number of messages in each 
conference that can be captured into a message capture file or a QWK packet.

The reason for setting this value to something other than a maximum number 
would be to either, limit the length of time it takes the caller to download 
a set of messages, or to keep a message capture from filling up the disk 
(especially if a ram disk is specified for the location of temporary files).

Name of Capture File (blank=caller#)

The name you enter is this field will be the file that is created for message 
captures.  A user can create a message capture file using the C, D, and Z 
subcommands of the R user command.  If you leave this field blank, the caller 
number will be used as the filename instead.  The capture file PCBoard 
creates, is stored in the Location of Temporary Work Files specified in 
PCBSetup | File Locations | System Files.

It is quite conceivable that a user could exceed the limits you have set for 
maximum messages per capture or conference.  In a situation where this 
occurs, they may decide to perform another capture.  To prevent this new 
packet from overwriting the packet they just barely downloaded, PCBoard will 
rename the capture file using the following conventions:

If the filename field was left blank or if the capture filename is 7 
characters or less, PCBoard will increment the filename by adding the letter 
A to the end of the caller number after the first packet is downloaded.  If 
yet another packet is downloaded, PCBoard will add a B to the caller number 
and so on.

If you specified a capture filename that has 8 characters in it, PCBoard 
cannot add a new character to the filename and still have a valid DOS 
filename.  Therefore, it will increment the last letter in the capture 
filename until it reaches the letter Z.

Name of QWK Packet (blank=capture name)

In this field, enter the name that will be used when creating QWK mail 
packets for users to download.  If you leave this field blank, then PCBoard 
will use the filename that you entered as your capture filename (in the 
previous field).

Be forewarned, however, that if you leave the capture filename blank as well, 
that your QWK packets will not be created.  The reason that no packet will be 
created is that the QWK mail standard expects to have a consistent base 
filename to work on. Of course, the caller number varies with each call so 
that cannot be used as a QWK packet name.

Usually, the best thing to do is to summarize your board name in 7 characters 
or less, use that abbreviation as the capture filename, and then leave your 
QWK packet filename blank.

As with capture files, if a user attempts to download more than one packet 
during a call, PCBoard is going to increment the filename so that the 
recently downloaded packet does not get overwritten.  QWK files are handled a 
little differently. PCBoard will give the first QWK packet an extension of 
QWK.  If another packet is downloaded, PCBoard will give it an extension of 
QW0 and so on.

Stop Clock for Capture File Download

During the download of a message capture or QWK packet file, you
can determine if you want to charge the user time for downloading the file or 
not.  The valid options are:

      N         Any time spent downloading a capture file or QWK packet will 
                be counted against the user's daily/session time limit.  If 
                the user had 30 minutes available before the transfer began 
                and it takes them 5 minutes to download, they will have 25 
                minutes of time left.

      Y         No time will be deducted from the daily/session time limit 
                when the user is downloading a capture file or QWK mail 
                packet. You may choose to set this option to give your users 
                extra incentive to download messages and read them offline.

Disable Message Scan Prompt

Normally when you login to PCBoard it will ask you if you wish to scan for 
messages.  This option controls whether or not that question is asked.  Valid 
responses are:

      N         With this setting, PCBoard will ask if the message base 
                should be scanned each time a user logs into the system.  In 
                addition, any conference that you join and did not scan at 
                login will also ask if you wish to scan the new mail.  The 
                difference is that at login, PCBoard will scan all 
                conferences you have selected for new mail.  It will show you 
                how many messages are new and if any are addressed to you.  
                If you join a conference which you have not selected for 
                scanning and are prompted to scan for new mail, only the 
                current conference will be scanned.

      Y         The prompt which asks the user if they wish to scan for 
                messages will be disabled.  This means that the user will not 
                be asked at login or even when they join conferences.

Allow ESC Codes in Messages

ESC (escape) codes are generally used to transmit ANSI sequences across the 
modem.  These codes could define color changes, cursor movements, etc.  To 
enter the ESC character into the message editor the ASCII 029 character 
should be used instead of ASCII 027.  This will avoid any conflicts with the 
full-screen editor and its use of ESC.  From the keyboard, the ASCII 029 
character can be entered by holding down A while typing 029 on the numeric 
keypad (a double sided arrow will be printed).  This option controls whether 
or not you want to allow users to enter the ESC character in the message 
editor.  The valid choices are:

      N         Users will not be allowed to enter the ESC character in their 
                messages.  In effect this would disable users from entering 
                ANSI color screens in their messages.  This in itself is not 
                a bad idea, because not all of your callers would be capable 
                of ANSI color graphics.  Colors can still be used in messages 
                using PCBoard's @X color codes.  PCBoard can interpret the @X 
                codes to determine if the caller is capable of color and 
                change the color if they are.

      Y         Users may enter ESC characters in their messages.  This would 
                allow users to enter ANSI screens inside of message. Remember 
                that not all of your callers will be capable of ANSI so the 
                ESC codes may appear to be garbage if a user is not capable 
                of ANSI.


Allow Carbon-Copy Messages

When a group of people are targeted for a particular message, one of the most 
practical methods for getting the message across is to carbon copy the 
message to several users.  This can be done by typing SC while at the message 
editor command prompt. Instead of simply saving the message, the user will be 
prompted for additional names the message should be carbon copied to. Each of 
the users specified in the list will be sent a copy of the message that is 
saved.  The valid options for this field are:

      N         The ability to save carbon copies of a message will not be 
                available to any user on the system.

      Y         Users may save carbon copies of messages to other users on 
                the system.  The maximum number of carbon copies can be 
                adjusted for each conference from the conference options 
                screen.

Validate TO: Name in Messages

To insure mail gets properly addressed to users on the system, you can enable 
this option to verify names entered in the TO: field of messages.  When a 
name is validated, PCBoard checks to see if the user name entered exists in 
the user file.  If no validation were done, a user could enter a message to a 
user who does not exist and wonder why a response was never received. The 
valid options are:

      N         No validation of the name that messages are addressed to will 
                be performed.  This means that it is up to the user to 
                properly enter the name of the user.

      Y         PCBoard will make sure that the name to whom the message is 
                being addressed, exists on the system.  If the name does not 
                exist, the user is warned that the user name could not be 
                found and given three options.  The user can choose to  
                re-enter the name, continue with a name which does not exist, 
                or perform a Soundex search to see if a similar sounding name 
                could be found.

NOTE:  Regardless of how you answer this question, no name validation will be 
done in a conference which has been configured as an echo conference.

Force COMMENTS-to-the-Sysop into Main

When you have several conferences on your system, you might find it very 
desirable to consolidate all of the messages that are entered using the C 
user command into the Main Board.  This will make it easy to read all of your 
comments without having to join all of the conferences on your system to see 
if you have mail waiting.  The valid options are:


      N         Leave the comment to the SysOp in the conference that the 
                user was in at the time the message was written.  The 
                advantage to selecting this option is that if the user 
                mentions something about the conference configuration but 
                does not reference the number or name you will know what 
                conference they are referring to.  The disadvantage is that 
                you may find comments in any conference on your system.

      Y         Any comments to the SysOp (using the C user command) will be 
                moved transparently to the Main Board conference.  The 
                advantage to selecting this option is that all of your 
                comments will be in one single location.  An additional 
                benefit would come into play if your have netmail conferences 
                and do not want the comments to the SysOp to get transferred 
                to the other systems in the network.

Double-Byte Characters (Foreign Systems)

PCBoard supports double byte (DB) characters by allowing changing line 
delimiters in the message base.  If you enable this feature you will be able 
to use DB characters in your messages, however, it is important to realize 
that the format of messages stored in this format are not compatible with 
systems or third party software that do not have DB characters enabled. Do 
not enable DBCS unless you need it.  The valid options are:

      N         When you select this menu option, PCBoard stores message in 
                the standard message base format.

      Y         Using this option will cause PCBoard to use a different line 
                delimiter in the message base.  This may very well render any 
                third party software for the message bases useless (unless 
                they also recognize DB characters).


NOTE:  If you change this setting, you will need to delete all of your 
message bases because they are stored in a different format based on this 
setting.  If you do not delete the message bases, your users may see message 
headers with no body.

Create MSGS File if Missing

If the message file is missing when a user joins a conference, PCBoard will 
normally create the file.  In certain situations though, it may be desirable 
to let PCBSetup create any missing message files for you.  In particular, if 
your system has a lot of nodes (e.g., more than 75), it would be quite 
possible that some other process could be accessing the message base (such as 
PCBPack) and for PCBoard to not find the message base.  PCBoard would create 
the message base which could destroy the pre-existing  message base.  The 
valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will not create the message base file if it does not 
                exist when a user joins a conference.  This will disable all 
                of the message functions if the message base does not exist, 
                but it will still allow the user to join the conference 
                without the risk of interfering with other processes.  The 
                only way to create the message base would be to exit and save 
                from within PCBSetup having your entire system checked.  If 
                PCBSetup finds a missing message base file it will create it 
                for you.

      Y         For most systems, this will be the desired setting.  This way 
                you do not have to worry about creating the message base 
                file. Instead, PCBoard will do all of the work for you.

Default to (Q)uick on Personal Mail Scan

There are two formats that can be used for scanning for personal mail - the 
long and quick formats.  The quick format uses one line per conference and 
lists the number of messages scanned and how many were addressed to you.  The 
long format displays more information and consequently takes more than one 
line for each conference.  This option allows you to determine if the quick 
format will be the default for message scans.  Valid options are:

      N         All mail scans will default to the long format.  If the short 
                format is desired, the Q subcommand can be used on those 
                commands which involve mail scans.

      Y         When you select this menu option, all mail scans will default 
                to quick mode.  If long mode is desired, the L subcommand can 
                be used on those commands that involve mail scans.

Default to Scan ALL Conferences at Login

When you login and just after PCBoard scans for new bulletins, you are asked 
if you wish to scan the message base since the last message you have read.  
This option will decide if only the current conference will be scanned or if 
all selected conferences will be scanned.  Valid options are:

      N         When this option is used, only the current message base will 
                be scanned for new messages.  Normally this would refer to 
                the Main Board, but you could define auto-rejoin conferences 
                so that users rejoin the conference they logged off in.

      Y         All conferences that have been selected for scanning will be 
                searched for new mail.  Remember that conferences are usually 
                selected for scanning using the SELECT user command.

Prompt to Read Mail when Mail Waiting

When a new message has been left for a caller, that caller will be informed 
of the new message with a pop-up message that indicates which conferences 
have new mail.  You can control whether the user is asked to read the mail 
right now or if only the pop-up message is displayed.  Valid options are:

      N         Display the pop-up message only.  The user will not be asked 
                if they wish to read the new mail.
 
      Y         As soon as the pop-up message is displayed, the user will be 
                asked if they wish to read the mail that is waiting for them.

NOTE:  Not all messages that are left on the system will set the mail waiting 
flags.  For example, some third party software will not update the flags nor 
will any generic messages you enter in PCBoard (e.g., @USER@, @##@)

File Transfers

Disallow BATCH Uploads

Normally you will want to encourage uploads to your system any way possible, 
and disabling batch uploads can hinder rather than promote uploads.   
However, for systems that accept uploads from foreign computing environments, 
such as a Macintosh, where the file naming conventions do not translate 
straight across to the DOS environment, it can sometimes be necessary to 
disallow batch uploads.  This avoids the problem that occurs when the batch 
protocol tries to convert the filenames.  Valid options are:

      N         This option will make PCBoard operate normally -- users may 
                do batch uploads.

      Y         Users will not be able to do batch uploads when this option 
                is set.  Because a user must enter a valid DOS filename to 
                begin an upload, this setting will force any file uploaded to 
                the filename specified by the user.  As mentioned previously, 
                this will prevent a problem when uploading a filename from a 
                foreign system which may try to create an invalid DOS 
                filename.

Promote to Batch Transfers

PCBoard has two commands for uploading files ( U and UB ).  The U command is 
usually recommended if one file is going to be uploaded and the UB command 
would be used to upload more than one file (a batch upload).  Some of your 
users may find this method complex or easy to forget and therefore, you are 
given the ability to automatically promote the U command to the UB command.  
Valid options are:

      N         The U command will always prompt for file one at a time. 
                Batch transfers could still occur by performing an 
                unannounced upload with a batch protocol.  However, the 
                descriptions will not be asked for up front.

      Y         The U command will automatically be promoted to the UB 
                command if the caller has selected a batch protocol (or no 
                protocol at all).


Upload Credit for Time

The value that you enter in this value will determine how much of the time 
spent while uploading files will be refunded to the user if their upload 
passes your integrity checks.  The default is 1.0 which means that by default 
PCBoard will stop the clock during an upload.  That is, for every minute a 
caller spends uploading, 1 minute of credit will be refunded.  Effectively, 
the caller will have the same amount of time left after the upload terminates 
as when the upload began.

Setting this value to something higher, such as 2.5, will refund 2.5 minutes 
of time for every minute spent uploading.  This means that if a user uploads 
for 2 minutes, they will receive a five minute refund.  Remember, that they 
also spent two minutes downloading so this means that a net credit of 3 
minutes would be received..  Once disconnected from the system, any time 
credits are lost.


NOTE:  No time credit will be added if the user's time has been adjusted for 
an upcoming expedited event.  This will help prevent your system from missing 
the expedited event.

Upload Credit for Bytes

This value defines the number of credits given to the caller for
each byte uploaded.  The default is 0 giving no credits at all. In other 
words, the user would have the same amount of daily download bytes available 
as when they began the upload.  You can reward the user for uploading by 
setting this value to any value above 0.  A setting of 1 would give the 
caller a 1 daily download byte credit for every byte uploaded.

The upload byte credit is a credit against the daily download byte limit.  
Therefore, the credits must be used on the same day in which they are posted 
or they will be lost.


NOTE:  If you are testing your uploads via PCBTEST.BAT then the upload must 
pass or no credit will be given.

Include 'Uploaded By' in Desc.

When a user uploads a file, this option will control whether or not the user 
who uploaded the file will be added as the last line in the description.  
Enabling this option is useful for quickly determining who uploaded a 
particular file to the system.

      N         The name of the user who uploaded the file is not added to 
                the description by PCBoard.

      Y         An additional line to the end of the description entered by 
                the user will be added to each file uploaded.  This 
                additional line will say Uploaded by: followed by the user 
                name who uploaded the file.

Verify Files Uploaded

After a file is uploaded, you can have PCBoard shell out to a batch file 
called PCBTEST.BAT to perform tests on the file that is uploaded.  The 
filename being tested is passed to the batch file as the first parameter.  
You can use any program you want in the PCBTEST.BAT file to test any criteria 
that you desire. Most SysOps are quite content to verify the integrity of 
compressed files and to check all files for viri.  For more information on 
PCBTEST.BAT  please see the Batch Files chapter of this manual.  Valid 
options are:

      N         No testing will be performed on files that are uploaded.
  
      Y         PCBoard will test each file (individually) after the upload 
                is complete.

Disable Drive Size Check

PCBoard normally checks the size of the hard disk and the amount of free 
space left before allowing an upload to take place. This information is 
displayed to the caller when they begin their upload (for informational 
purposes).  You can choose whether or not to enable the drive size check.  
Valid options are:

      Y          PCBoard will not check to make sure sufficient space is 
                 available before an upload begins.  Likewise, the amount of 
                 free space on your upload drive will not be printed to your 
                 callers. If your system does not properly support the 
                 checking of free space or if you simply do not want the 
                 information shown to your callers, select this option.

      N          PCBoard will check to ensure that there is enough free space 
                 on the hard drive before beginning an upload.  The amount of 
                 free space that is checked for is determined by the Stop 
                 Uploads when Free Space is less than field on this same 
                 configuration screen.

Upload Buffer Size (4-64)

Enter the size of the upload buffer.  This setting can affect the performance 
of your system during uploads.  You should experiment with different values 
between 4 and 64 for your own system to see what works best.

It is recommended that you set this value to a multiple of the cluster size 
of your hard drive.  For instance, if you have a hard drive partition that is 
greater than 256 megabytes but less than 512 megabytes then your cluster size 
is 8 kilobytes.  A setting of 8 should be the minimum used for the best 
performance.

List of Slow Drive Letters

If you have a slow server, a CD-ROM, or even more importantly, a carousel 
(multi-disk) CD-ROM, it may be beneficial to copy files that are to be 
transferred off the slow drive down to the temporary directory which could 
possibly be a faster local hard drive or ram drive.

You can indicate for which drives this copying step should be performed by 
typing a list of drive letters in this field.  For example, if you enter IKX 
in this field, any file that is downloaded from drive I, K, or X will be 
copied to the temporary directory before the download begins.

For those who have a device like a carousel CD-ROM (multiple CD-ROMs but only 
one is read at a time) you can specify a range of drive letters that make up 
the device.  For example, let's assume that you had a CD-ROM carousel that 
held 6 discs and used drive letters H, I, J, K, L, and M.  To make PCBoard 
treat all 6 drive letters as one device you would enter H-M in the slow drive 
field.  The dash is used to represent a range of drive letters.  By entering 
H-M you are telling PCBoard to treat drives H, I, J, K, L, and M as one 
device.

When copying files from a drive on your system, PCBoard will lock access to 
that slow drive so that system performance is not driven into the ground.  If 
the drive is already slow there is no sense to try copying two files at the 
same time.  PCBoard is going to impose a maximum wait period of 90 seconds 
for a slow drive to finish copying a file.  If the slow drive is not free by 
that time, PCBoard will simply download the file directly from the slow 
drive.

Now you can see why it is important to be able to specify a range of letters 
to treat as one device.  Without this capability, it would be quite possible 
for a CD-ROM carousel device to spend most of its time swapping disks rather 
than exchanging meaningful data so that users could get more done is less 
time.

NOTE:  If there is insufficient space in your temporary directory to hold all 
files that are requested for download, PCBoard will not copy the file.  
Instead, it will continue with the download of the file leaving it on the 
slow drive for the transfer.

Slow Drive Batch File

If you have designated some drives as slow drives, you can optionally have 
PCBoard execute a batch file once the file has been copied.  PCBoard will run 
the batch file that is specified in this field and pass the filename as the 
first parameter to the batch file.  Inside of the batch file, you can run a 
program to set the comment in a compressed file or whatever your needs 
dictate.  

Stop Uploads when Free Space is less than

The value that you enter in this field is multiplied by 1024 to determine the 
number of bytes that should be free on your upload drive before allowing an 
upload to occur.  For example, if you enter 100 here, you will need to have 
100 kilobytes of free disk space or PCBoard will not allow the user to upload 
any files.

The fact is, you do not know how big an upload is going to be and you want to 
make sure that you do not run out of storage space on your drive or it may 
present a problem for other users. The most detrimental situation would be if 
you store your users file and your uploads on the same drive..  If you allow 
that drive to fill-up, your user file could not be increased in size. If the 
user file cannot grow, new users will not be allowed to log into your system.

If you store system files on the same drive as your upload drive, you should 
set this value to something in excess of 3000 to give yourself some safe 
breathing room.  The best alternative may be to use separate drives for your 
system files and files that get uploaded to your system.

System Control

Disable NS Logon Feature

If a user adds NS to their response at the Do you want graphics prompt at 
login, PCBoard will not display the news file.  The will enable the user to 
login to the system faster than they would if they had to view the news file.  
You may find that some users will use this option without ever manually 
checking the news.  This would not present a good situation if you use the 
news file to display important information.  Valid options are:

      N         Allow users to skip the news file at login.

      Y         Do not allow users to skip the news file at login.

Disable Password Check (DOS)

If you have your modem configured to automatically answer the phone (instead 
of PCBoard), you run the risk of a security breach when returning back from a 
non-shelled door application. What could happen is that the user could drop 
carrier after they exit door but before PCBoard reloads.  If it takes a while 
for PCBoard to reload, a user could conceivably establish carrier before 
PCBoard reloads.  Of course, if there is carrier when PCBoard resumes, it 
must assume that the user is still on-line. In a situation like this it might 
be desirable to verify the password of the user when returning from a door.  
Valid options are:

      N         When returning from any door application, PCBoard will not 
                ask for any passwords.  This is the desired setting for most 
                systems since they will be configured to let PCBoard answer 
                the phone.  This eliminates the possibility of having someone 
                connect while PCBoard is reloading.

      Y         The option gives you the ability to verify the password of 
                the user that PCBoard thinks is on-line upon returning from a 
                non-shelled door application.  The disadvantage to this is 
                that your callers may become easily annoyed especially if 
                they open several doors.  You should only enable this if you 
                must force your modem to answer the phone instead of PCBoard 
                which is not recommended.

Multi-Lingual Operation

In PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration Files the filename for the 
multi-lingual data file is specified.  PCBoard uses this file to determine 
which operational languages can be selected at login.  You may want to be 
able to quickly enable or disable multi-lingual operation.  Valid options 
are:

      N         Multi-lingual operation is disabled.  Even if you have 
                defined the languages in your mult-lingual data file, the 
                user will not be prompted to select a language.

      Y         Select this option if you have defined your languages in the 
                multi-lingual data file and if you want to prompt your users 
                to select a language at login.

Disable Full Record Updating

You may want to protect certain user information that a user is normally 
allowed to edit with the W user command.  This option will determine if the 
user can edit their city, phone numbers, comment #1 field of their user 
record using the previously mentioned user command.  The valid options are:

      N         All fields that can be edited using the W user command can be 
                modified.

      Y         All fields with the exception of the city, passwords, and 
                comment #1 fields can be edited by the user.

Allow Alias Change after Chosen

After a caller has selected an alias it may not be desirable to allow the 
caller to change the alias without SysOp intervention. Preventing the caller 
from changing his alias avoids problems where one caller tries to leave 
messages (or do other things) using various names to create confusion.

      N         Once the alias is entered the first time (using the W user 
                command), the user may not change their alias.  Instead, they 
                must request that the SysOp change their name.

      Y         The user may change their alias at any time by using the W 
                command.

NOTE:  For aliases to be active you must install the Alias PSA
from within System Manager.

Run System as a Closed Board

Normally PCBoard will allow new callers to call in and log into the system 
creating a new user record in your users file as they log into the system.  
However, you may wish to restrict new users from logging into your system.  
Valid options are:

      N         New users may login to your system without being restricted.

      Y         New users will not be allowed to login to your system unless 
                a NEWASK questionnaire exists.  If the NEWASK questionnaire 
                exists, the user will be allowed to login, and answer the 
                questions.  However, no user record will be created for this 
                user.  The intention here is that you can use the NEWASK 
                questionnaire to screen your callers and then manually enter 
                a user account for them.

Enforce Daily Time Limit

Depending on the nature of your system, you may want to restrict your users 
to an absolute daily time limit, or simply a session limit.  With a session 
limit, your users can call back as many times as desired during the day but 
they are only allocated a certain amount of time for each call or session.

      N         With either this option set or if the Enforce Time Limit 
                field in the PWRD file is set to N for the security level of 
                the user, the time limit defined in the PWRD file will be 
                considered a session time limit.

      Y         When this option and the Enforce Time Limit field in the PWRD 
                file is set to Y, the time limits defined are daily time 
                limits.

Allow One Name Users

Normally PCBoard requires that two or more names be used when logging into 
the system.  There are some people that have only one name (believe it or 
not) and some SysOps like to run alias systems where real names are not used 
and these sometimes are only a single name.  An additional possibility for a 
one name user would be when you assign all of your users a number or unique 
ID for their name.  Valid options are:

      N         Users will be forced to enter at least two names to login 
                (e.g., first name and last name).  If they attempt to login 
                with one name, PCBoard will inform them that they must enter 
                a first and last name to login.

      Y         Users may enter one name to login to the system.  If the 
                majority of your users will have one name, you may want to 
                modify the Enter your first name prompt in PCBTEXT to say 
                something like Enter your user name instead.

Allow Password Failure Comment

When logging into the system, the user is given four attempts to enter the 
correct password.  This field controls what happens if the user does not 
enter the proper password after four attempts. Valid options are:

      N         The user will be informed that the password is incorrect and 
                that they are being logged off for excessive password 
                failures.

      Y         The user will be asked if they wish to leave a comment to the 
                SysOp.  This option would be useful because the caller could 
                give you a voice number or some other type of identification 
                so that they may login to the system again.  Otherwise, they 
                would have to create a new user account to get your 
                attention.

Warning on Logoff Command

If you have users that accidentally log off of your system quite
often, you may want to use this option to ask the user if they
really wish to log off of your system.  Valid options are:

      N          The connection will be terminated without confirmation.

      Y          PCBoard will ask that the user confirm that they really wish 
                 to log off.  This confirmation can be skipped even when 
                 enabled if the BYE user command is used instead of the G 
                 user command.

Allow Local SHELL to DOS

You may want to disable the ability for users who are logged in locally to 
shell to DOS using the F5 key.  Valid options are:

      N         Do not allow local shells to DOS.  That means that whenever a 
                user is logged in locally, they cannot press F5 to shell to 
                DOS. This would be useful if you have a lot of users who log 
                in locally and you want to refuse their access to DOS.

      Y         While logged in locally, F5 will shell the user to DOS 
                allowing them to enter DOS commands.

Use NEWASK+Standard Questions

When a new user calls in PCBoard will normally ask either the built-in new 
user questions, the ones required to set up a user record in the users file, 
or it will ask the questions in the NEWASK file and not register the user (if 
you are running your system as a closed board).  Valid options are:

      N         New users will be asked only the standard questions.

      Y         The built-in questions (phone numbers, protocol, etc.) will 
                be asked in addition to the NEWASK questionnaire.  This gives 
                you the ability to get more information out of your new 
                users.

Read PWRD on Conference Join

Normally PCBoard does not re-read the PWRD file after the caller joins a 
conference.  If, however, you have a security level increase (or decrease) in 
a particular conference you may want to reread the PWRD file to determine new 
limits for the user. Valid options are:

      N         When the user joins a conference, PCBoard uses the values 
                stored in memory when it initially read the PWRD file.

      Y         Each time a user joins a conference, PCBoard will re-read the 
                PWRD file to update the user's time limit, ratio, etc.

Confirm Caller Name / Address

If you have a large number of users, it is quite possible that you may have 
people that attempt to login using common names. For example, you may already 
have a BOB SMITH on the system (from Tulsa, Oklahoma).  A few months later, a 
new user attempts to login as BOB SMITH and is greeted for a password prompt. 
Obviously, there is a name conflict, and the new user will have to pick a new 
name.  This field allows you to confirm the city name of the user before 
asking for the password.  Valid options are

      N         Do not confirm the city name after the user name is entered. 
                this setting is recommended if you do not have a large user 
                base (5000+ users)

      Y         This setting is recommended if you have a large user base. 
                After the user name is entered, PCBoard will confirm the 
                city/location information.

Auto-Reg in Public Conf

When a new user calls in, PCBoard will automatically register the caller in 
public conferences where the security level required to join is set to 0.  It 
does this by scanning all existing conferences and setting the R, X, and S 
conference flags in the user's record.  This process can take a long time if 
you have a large number of conferences.  Valid options are:

      N         Do not automatically register users in public conferences. 
                Users will not have any conference flags set in the public 
                conferences aforementioned.

      Y         Users will have the R, X, and S conference flags set in 
                public conferences which require a security level of 0 to 
                join.


Encrypt Users File

For some installations of PCBoard, the ability to encrypt key information in 
the user file is critical.  For example, when PCBoard is used for local 
access across a network it would not be unlikely for one of your users to 
copy your USERS file from the network.  However, if your file is encrypted, 
they will not be able to easily obtain the critical information of the user 
file.  The following field in each user file will be encrypted:


password
city
phone numbers (data and voice)
the two comment fields


If you do plan on encrypting your user file, then you need to run ENCRYPT.EXE 
on your user file.  This is the utility that will actually encrypt the user 
file.  This field, is used only to tell PCBoard if your user file has been 
encrypted.  Valid options for this field are:

      N         Your user file has not been encrypted.  This will force 
                PCBoard to access the user file as if it has not been 
                encrypted. This will be the setting for the majority of 
                PCBoard systems.

      Y         If you have already run ENCRYPT.EXE on your user file then 
                this will force PCBoard to work in encryption mode.  Your 
                user's file will be encrypted on disk, but PCBoard will 
                properly translate the encrypted data as it reads the data 
                from disk. It is critical that this setting be the same on 
                all nodes. Otherwise, PCBoard encrypted data could be 
                mistaken as unmodified data (or vice versa) and end up 
                corrupting information in the user file.

Configuration Switches

Disable 3-minute Screen Clear

At the call waiting screen, PCBoard will automatically clear the screen after 
three minutes of inactivity.  In essence, PCBoard is enabling a screen-saving 
feature.  Valid options for this field are:

      N         PCBoard will enable the screen-saving feature after three 
                minutes of inactivity.  This is especially useful if you 
                leave you monitor(s) on for extended lengths of time.

      Y         Do not clear the screen if the system has been inactive for 
                more than three minutes.

Disable Registration Edits

Normally, PCBoard attempts to control what the user can enter at certain 
prompts when a user is logging into your system as a new user.  The prompts 
that are effected by the setting of this switch are:


first and last name prompts (high ASCII characters are normally disabled)
new user questions (phone numbers, city/location, etc.)


For example, when PCBoard asks for the phone number of the user, it is 
expecting that only numbers and certain punctuation characters be entered in 
this field.  If you use MKPCBTXT to ask a question other than the user's 
phone number you most likely do not want to restrict entry of that field to 
numbers.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will operate in normal mode.  This means that certain 
                fields will have restricted output.
 
      Y         Any data can be entered in the affected fields.  In essence, 
                these fields become free-form edit fields where no checking 
                is performed.

Disable High-ASCII Filter

With non-error correcting modems line noise could come in the form of any 
characters including high ASCII characters.  Since most users do not enter 
these characters at the keyboard, this switch is used to control if high 
ASCII characters can be entered at various prompts and in the message editor.  
Of course if you want to allow your users to enter high-ASCII characters or 
if you are using a foreign language which makes use of the high-ASCII then 
you may want to disable the filter.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will continue to filter high ASCII characters.  If 
                you are doing this to prevent line noise from being input you 
                may want to reconsider because error-correcting modems are 
                gaining in popularity which will prevent line noise from 
                being mistaken for valid input.

      Y         The high ASCII filter is disabled allowing users to enter 
                these characters at most prompts and also inside of the 
                message editor.  This would be the ideal setting if you use 
                languages that make use of these characters or if your users 
                upload a lot of graphics screens.

Default to Graphics At Login

Throughout the operation of PCBoard, the default choice is usually the safest 
choice.  In certain circumstances, however, you may not want this.  For 
example, if the majority of your users have ANSI capabilities but regularly 
press ENTER at the Do you want graphics prompt then they will default to no 
graphics.  You can make it so that the default selection at that prompt is to 
select ANSI graphics based on the answer you enter in this field.  Valid 
options are:

      N         This will provide the safest choice.  If a user presses ENTER 
                when asked if they wish to have graphics, PCBoard will 
                default to non-graphics mode.  This way a user does not see 
                meaningless ANSI escape sequences if they are not capable of 
                ANSI.

      Y         If the user presses ENTER when asked if they want graphics, 
                PCBoard will default to ANSI graphics mode.  If the user is 
                not capable of ANSI graphics, their screen will appear to 
                filled with garbage characters.  You may only want to use 
                this if a majority of your callers are capable of ANSI.

Use Non-Graphics Mode Only

If you do not want to have ANSI graphics mode available to your callers, you 
may want to enable this option.  When this option is enabled, PCBoard will 
not even ask the user if they want graphics.  Instead, it will assume that 
the user does not want graphics.  PCBoard will still send the ANSI detection 
sequence to see if the user is capable of ANSI so that screen displays can be 
drawn faster, etc.  Users can still change their display mode by using the M 
user command. Valid options for this field are:

      N         Operate if a normal fashion by letting the user determine if 
                they want graphics or not.  This means that the question 
                about wanting graphics will be asked at login.

      Y         The user is not asked if they want to use graphics.  Instead, 
                PCBoard is going to default to no graphics.

Exclude Local Logins from Stats

On the call-waiting screen, PCBoard keeps track of how many calls, messages 
that have been entered, and files that have been transferred since the last 
time you reset the stats.  This option will control whether or not the 
actions that take place on local logins (Sysop or user logging in from the 
call-waiting screen) will affect the stats on the call-waiting screen.  Valid 
options are:

      N         All calls, whether remote or local will affect the 
                call-waiting stats.

      Y         Do not increment the statistics on the call waiting screen 
                when yourself or another user logs into the system locally.

Exit to DOS After Each Call

Normally PCBoard recycles after each call by closing all files and restarting 
itself.  However, you may need to perform some task between the time PCBoard 
disconnects the caller and returns to the call waiting screen.  An additional 
possibility is that you may need to load another application which answers 
the phone instead of PCBoard.  If either of these situations fit into your 
configuration, you will need to exit to DOS after each call. Valid options 
for this field are:

      N         Recycle using the normal sequence (return directly to the 
                call-waiting screen).

      Y         Exit to DOS after each call.  In the structure of the default 
                BOARD.BAT file, PCBoard is going to branch to the :END label. 
                Therefore, you should place any DOS commands that you want 
                executed after each call after the :END label in your 
                BOARD.BAT file.

Eliminate Screen Snow in PCB

When PCBoard updates the screen, it does so by writing directly to the video 
buffer which can, on some CGA-based systems, cause snow to appear on the 
screen while it's being updated.  Your callers will not see this but it could 
be distracting to you.

      N         Operate normally in respect to writing data directly to the 
                screen buffer.  If you have a CGA adapter, you may need to 
                select Y instead.

      Y         Disables the screen snow that is possible with certain CGA 
                adapters.  Selecting this option will slow down screen 
                updates slightly.

Display NEWS Only if Changed

This field has one purpose -- to control when the news file will
be displayed to the caller.  Valid options for this field are:

      A         Display the news file every time a conference is joined.  If 
                this is what you desire, you may find that the conference 
                INTRO (defined in the configuration for each conference) may 
                be better suited for this purpose.

      N         Display the news file for each conference once per day.  Once 
                the news file has been displayed that day, it will not be 
                shown again.

      Y         Display the news file only if the data of the news file is 
                the same as or more recent than the caller's last logon date.

Display User Info at Login

This field controls whether or not you wish to display some user statistics 
at login.  Information such as the last call date, the number of calls made 
to the system, expert mode status, and similar information is displayed.  
Valid options are:

      N         Do not display user information at login.  Nearly all the 
                information PCBoard displays can be accessed using @ macros. 
                Therefore, you can incorporate the user statistics into one 
                of your display screens if you wish.

      Y         The user statistics will be displayed just before the 
                conference command prompt when a user is logging in.  In 
                addition, when a user joins a conference, they will be shown 
                the last message they have read, the high message number, and 
                the number of active messages in the conference.  This will 
                only be displayed once per conference.

Pre-load PCBTEXT File

All of the prompts and other messages that PCBoard displays come out of the 
PCBTEXT file.  You can speed up some of PCBoard's displays by having PCBoard 
load this file into memory.  This is called pre-loading.  Valid options are:

      N         When needed, read the information required from the PCBTEXT 
                file on disk.  This may slow down performance, but it saves 
                the memory that would otherwise be taken by pre-loading the 
                file.

      Y         The PCBTEXT file will be loaded into memory.  This will 
                reduce the amount of time that it takes to display 
                information from the PCBTEXT file.  In addition, if you store 
                the PCBTEXT file on a network server this option will reduce 
                the network traffic on your system.  The disadvantage to 
                selecting this option is that additional memory will be used 
                by pre-loading it into memory.

Pre-load CNAMES File

Whenever a caller joins a conference or scans for mail in different 
conferences PCBoard must get the conference information from the CNAMES.@@@ 
and CNAMES.ADD files.  This can put on a lot of wear on your hard disk and it 
can be relatively slow depending on how fast your hard drive or network 
connection is.  You can choose to pre-load the CNAMES information into memory 
to speed-up access to that information.  However, you do so at the expense of 
memory.  Valid options are:

      N         The CNAMES information will not be pre-loaded.  Instead, the 
                information will be obtained directly by accessing the disk 
                as needed.

      Y         The CNAMES information will be loaded into memory.  This will 
                allow PCBoard to access the information quicker and also 
                increase the memory requirements of PCBoard.  Approximately 
                650 bytes of memory will be used for each conference in your 
                system.

Scan for New Bulletins

This question determines if PCBoard should scan for new bulletins during 
every login.  Normally, the scan for new bulletins will occur around the time 
that NEWS file is displayed (when it displays).  You may not want to scan for 
new bulletins if you have a large number of bulletins on-line.

      N         Do not scan for new bulletins.  This setting would reduce the 
                amount of  time it takes to login if you have a large number 
                of bulletins on-line.

      Y         Scan for new bulletins.  PCBoard is able to scan hundreds of 
                bulletins in a very brief amount of time.  If you have a lot 
                of bulletins on-line, you may not want to scan for new 
                bulletins to reduce the login time for your users.

Swap Out During Shell

Normally the PCBoard executable, and all of the data it is currently working 
on, remains in memory while it is operating. This information remains in 
memory even when shelling out to DOS thereby reducing the amount of free 
memory by the amount that PCBoard, and its data, are occupying.

This option will control whether or not PCBoard will swap itself out of 
memory during various shell to DOS operations (executing PCBTEST.BAT, 
PCBVIEW.BAT, etc.).  Valid options for this field are:

      N         When shelling out, do not swap any data out of memory.  You 
                will have less memory available when shelling to DOS (usually 
                under 300 kilobytes).

      Y         PCBoard will swap itself out of memory (leaving about 25K of 
                memory behind to re-load) during a shell to DOS operation. It 
                will swap this information out to whichever storage medium is 
                available (EMS, XMS, and finally disk).  This will generally 
                increase the amount of memory by about 200 kilobytes or more.

Swap Out During $$LOGON/LOGOFF.BAT

Due to the need to speed up the processing of $$LOGON.BAT and $$LOGOFF.BAT, 
PCBoard normally does not swap itself out when running these batch files - 
regardless of the previous setting (Swap Out During Shell).

If you are running software that requires more memory than is available 
during a non-swap shell to $$LOGON or $$LOGOFF, you may want to swap out when 
these batch files are run.  Valid options are:

      N         The swap during shell setting will be ignored and a normal 
                DOS shell will be performed to execute the $$LOGON.BAT and 
                $$LOGOFF.BAT files.

      Y         PCBoard will swap memory out leaving approximately 25 
                kilobytes to reload whenever the logon and logoff batch files 
                are executed.

Create USERS.SYS for $$LOGON.BAT

In order to keep $$LOGON.BAT processing quick, PCBoard will not normally take 
the time required to create a USERS.SYS file since most programs that you 
would run in your $$LOGON.BAT file will not require it.

      N         This is the default setting.  No USERS.SYS file will be 
                created when the logon batch file is executed.

      Y         If you have an application that needs USERS.SYS while running 
                in your logon batch file, you should choose this setting.

Capture GROUP CHAT Session to Disk

Normally PCBoard will not capture information that is typed in by callers 
during group chat due to the disk intensive nature of group chat.  If you 
would like to keep a record of what users type while in group chat, enable 
this option.  Valid options for this field are:

      N         Do not capture what is said during group chat.  This will
                save you disk space and will not burden group chat with any 
                more disk-intensive operations.

      Y         PCBoard will record the what is written but only after a user 
                presses ENTER.  The capture file will contain the date, time, 
                user name, node number, and what was typed.  Their will be a 
                capture file for each channel (up to 255) in group chat.  The 
                location of the chat capture files are determined by PCBSetup 
                | File Locations | System Files.

Allow Handles in GROUP CHAT

In group chat, PCBoard will normally allow the user to select a handle to be 
known as while in chat.  For some systems the ability for the user to hide 
their identity might be very undesirable.  Because of this, PCBoard will give 
you the choice to allow users to use a handle while in chat.  Valid options 
are:

      N         Users may not choose a handle while in group chat.  Instead, 
                their first name will be used while in group chat.

      Y         When entering group chat, users will be asked to enter a 
                handle they wish to use to identify themselves while in group 
                chat.  If the user wants to change their handle while in 
                group chat, they can type HANDLE at the chat command prompt.


Logging Options

Log Caller Number to Disk

PCBoard stores the vital information about each call in what is termed the 
caller logs.  These provide a call-by-call history of each node on your 
system.  You may want to record the caller number of each user for reference 
purposes.  Valid options are:

      N         PCBoard will not write the caller number to the caller logs.  

      Y         The caller number of each caller will be written to the log 
                file.  The format will be:

                    Caller Number: 9,999,999
 
Log Connect String to Disk

With all of the various connection types and possibilities of today's modems, 
it might be useful for you to be able to see what type connect a particular 
user established for their session.  For example, if you get a user that 
complains about slow transfer rates, it could be that the modem did not 
connect at full-speed initially due to poor phone lines.  By logging this 
information to disk, this information will be available to you.  In addition, 
any CallerID information will be written to disk as well.

      N         The connect string that the modem gave PCBoard will not be 
                written to the caller logs.

      Y         The connect string and any CallerID information will be 
                written to the caller logs. 

NOTE:  In order for CallerID information to be written to the caller logs, 
you must set PCBoard to answer after at least 2 rings and have this option 
enabled.

Log Security Level to Disk

Sometimes it is useful to know the security level of the user at login 
written to the caller logs.  This option will control whether or not the 
security level at login will be written to the caller logs.  Valid options 
for this field are:

      N         The security level of the caller will not be written to the 
                caller logs.

      Y         The security level of the caller at login will be written to 
                the caller logs.  Remember that the security level of a user 
                can be reduced or increased when joining a conference.

Limits

Keyboard Timeout (in min, 0=disable)

Sometimes users will have to walk away from their system or may forget they 
were on-line.  To prevent the connection from being active until the user's 
time limit expires or they finally remember, PCBoard allows you to set a 
keyboard time-out value.

If no activity is detected from the caller in the number of minutes that you 
specify in this field, PCBoard will automatically disconnect the caller for 
inactivity.  This will free up the node for other callers to get in and may 
also save money for those callers that are calling in long distance. 

In this field, enter the number of minutes of inactivity a user can have 
before they will be logged off of the system.  As a general rule, a value 
between 3 and 5 would be good for most callers.  If you enter a value of 0, 
the keyboard time-out will be inactive which will enable the caller to stay 
on-line until their daily/session time limit expires.

No warning is given to the user about keyboard inactivity until the final 
minute before they are disconnected.  During this final minute, PCBoard will 
send a beep every 10 seconds to alert the caller.  After this minute expires, 
PCBoard will disconnect the caller.

Max Number of Upload Description Lines

This field controls how many lines the user is given to enter descriptions 
for their uploads.  You may enter any value between 1 and 60.  Each 
description line may contain 45 characters of text to describe the uploaded 
file.  In general a limit of 8 to 10 is sufficient for most systems.

Maximum Number of Lines in Scrollback

While logged on locally, PCBoard maintains a scrollback buffer which you can 
use to review information that has already scrolled off the screen.  The 
scrollback buffer can be viewed by pressing the o key.

The maximum lines that you can specify is about 400 which will use up 
approximately 64 kilobytes of memory.  Setting a lower number will save some 
memory and a setting of 0 will totally disable the scrollback buffer.

NOTE:  A minimum of 30 lines is required unless you disable the scroll back 
buffer completely.  In other words, if you set your scrollback buffer to any 
value between one and 30 lines, the value of 30 will be forced regardless of 
your setting.

DOS Environment Size When Shelled Out

When PCBoard shells out to DOS via COMMAND.COM it is possible to request (of 
COMMAND.COM) a larger environment size.  The value you set here will be 
passed to COMMAND.COM as a command line parameter such as /E:768 (where 768 
would be the value that you have chosen).

Increasing the environment size may be required if you have a large number of 
environment variables.   In general, a value of 1024 or higher is not 
recommended.

Number Days Before FORCED Password Change

When you have installed the Password Changing PSA, it gives you the ability 
to force the caller to change their password after a certain amount of days.  
By forcing your users to regularly change their password, you can be help 
increase the overall security of your system, because a user's password may 
not be as easy to hack.

This particular field allows you to determine after how many days the user 
will be forced to change their password.  A setting of 0 will disable the 
automatic renewal of forced password changes and, instead, the only way to 
force a password change is to manually edit the user record (via PCBSM) and 
change the expiration date on the password.

A setting such as 90 will cause the caller's password to expire every 90 
days.  This will cause PCBoard to automatically require a new password, for 
continued access, every 90 days.

NOTE:  For this field to have any effect, the Password Changing PSA must be 
installed.

Number Days to Warn Prior to FORCED Change

If the user's password is set to expire, either from manually setting the 
expiration date, or from the automatic setting caused by the Number of Days 
Before FORCED Password Change, PCBoard will give the caller a warning of the 
upcoming expiration during the login process.

In this field, specify the number of days prior to expiration that this 
warning should be displayed to the caller.

NOTE:  For this field to have any effect, the Password Changing PSA must be 
installed.

Minimum Password Length

When the Password Changing PSA is installed, PCBoard will automatically force 
a minimum length for a password.  The minimum password length is determined 
by the number that you enter in this field.  If you enter a value of 0, there 
will be no password length restriction enforced.

NOTE:  For this field to have any effect, the Password Changing
PSA must be installed.

Allow Sysop Page Start Time

When the page bell is toggled on from the call-waiting screen or by pressing 
F4 while logged in, this field defines the time at which you will begin 
allowing callers to page the SysOp.  If the user attempts to page the SysOp 
during off-hours, they will be informed the SysOp is not available for chat 
and asked if they wish to leave a comment instead.

For example, you might want to be available for chat between the hours of  
8:00am to 5:00 pm. If this is what you desire, enter 08:00 in this field.

Allow Sysop Page Stop Time

When the page bell is toggled on from the call-waiting screen or by pressing 
F4 while logged in, this field defines the end time at which callers will no 
longer be able to page the SysOp.  If the user attempts to page the SysOp 
during off-hours, they will be informed that the SysOp is not available for 
chat and asked if they wish to leave a comment instead.

For example, you might want to be available for chat between the hours of  
8:00am to 5:00 pm. If this is what you desire, enter 17:00 in this field.

Colors

Default Color (@X code format)

In certain areas of your system, PCBoard uses a default color for displaying 
text.  The color of the text used in the body of a message is just one 
example.  In this field, enter the @X color you want to use as your default 
color.

For example, if you want your default to be light gray on a black background, 
enter 07 in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header DATE Line

The color code entered in this field will control the color used for the 
first line of the message header.  This is the line that will display the 
date, message number, etc.

For example, if you want the color to be white text on a cyan background, 
enter 3F in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header TO Line

The color code entered in this field, will control the color used for the 
second line of the message header.  This is the line that will display the 
user who the message is addressed to.

For example, if you want the color to be white text on a blue background, 
enter 1F in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header FROM Line

The color code entered in this field will determine the color for the third 
line of the message header.  This is the line that displays who the message 
is from.

For example, if you want the color to be white text on a blue background, 
enter 1F in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header SUBJ Line

The color code entered in this field will determine the color used for the 
forth line of the message header.  This line in the header displays the 
subject of the message.

For example, if you want the color to be white text on a blue background, 
enter 1F in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header READ Line

The color code entered in this field will control the color displayed on the 
fifth line of the message header.  This line is only displayed when the long 
style message header is being used by the caller.  On this line PCBoard will 
display whether or not the message has been read by the recipient and what 
type of security is in use for the message.

For example, if you want the color to be cyan text on a blue background, 
enter 13 in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various 
colors you can select, please see the Display Files section in the 
Customizing Your BBS chapter of this manual.

Color for Message Header CONF Line

The color code entered in this field will control the color displayed on the 
sixth line of the message header.  This line is only displayed when the long 
style message header is being used by the caller.  On this line PCBoard will 
display the conference number and the type of read that is currently in use.

For example, if you want your default to be cyan on a blue background, enter 
13 in this field.  For more information on @X codes and the various colors 
you can select, please see the Display Files section in the Customizing Your 
BBS chapter of this manual.

Function Keys

Pre-defined function keys allow you to send text by holding down SHIFT and 
pressing the function key listed to the left of each field on this screen.  
For example, if you regularly add a signature to the bottom of your messages, 
you may want to define a function key to do it for you.  In other words, when 
you execute the function key, your signature will be typed in for you instead 
of you having to type it in.

Sending Text

You are given 60 characters to enter text you want sent when you execute a 
function key.  The text that you enter in this field will be sent directly to 
PCBoard with one exception.  If you enter ^M anywhere in a function key 
field, it will be treated as if you pressed ENTER.

Sending The Contents Of A File

If you need more than 60 characters to be sent by a function key, you can 
tell PCBoard to send the contents of an entire file.  To do this, begin the 
line with a % followed by the filename that you want to send to PCBoard.

Executing A PPE File

Another action you can define is to run a PPE file when a particular function 
key is executed.  To run a PPE from a function key, begin the line with an ! 
followed by the filename of the PPE (including the .PPE extension) you want 
to execute.

Examples

Let's assume that you have entered the following information for your 
function keys:

The following describes each action that would occur for the function keys 
defined in the previous screen capture are executed:


      SHIFT-F1     This particular example might be used as a signature when 
                   leaving messages on your system.  Instead of repetitively 
                   typing your name you could press SHIFT-F1 to have PCBoard 
                   enter all of this text for you.

      SHIFT-F2     When PCBoard detects file access errors it will write an 
                   entry to the caller logs.  This entry will usually contain 
                   either the word FAIL or ERROR.  This particular example 
                   would be quite useful if you wished to regularly scan your 
                   caller logs to see if your system may have a configuration 
                   error or problems accessing certain files.  Instead of 
                   typing the command in every day, you could use a function 
                   key to do all of the work for you.

      SHIFT-F3     This example demonstrates how to have PCBoard stuff the 
                   contents of a file into the keyboard.  When you press 
                   SHIFT-3, PCBoard will enter the contents of 
                   C:\PCB\GEN\NEW-WELC just as if you had typed it yourself.  
                   Remember, when you want to have the contents of a file 
                   stuffed, you need to begin the function key definition 
                   with a % character.

      SHIFT-F4     The simple fact that you may run a PPE opens up numerous 
                   possibilities.  The example shown in the previous screen 
                   capture would execute C:\PCB\PPE\TAGLINES.PPE.  Remember, 
                   to specify that a PPE file should be used for a function 
                   key definition, you need to enter an ! as the first 
                   character of the definition field.  In addition, you must 
                   also specify the filename extension of .PPE on your file 
                   you wish to execute.


Security Levels

This section discusses the Security Levels menu option of PCBSetup.   From 
this menu option, you can control the security level that is required to 
execute commands or certain functions. The following page begins by 
discussing how to protect SysOp functions.

Sysop Functions

The fields on this screen give you the ability to control what security level 
is required to execute the SysOp Commands (1-15). Each of the 15 SysOp 
commands are represented on this screen. The fact that you can assign 
different levels to different commands, gives you the ability to have several 
users who help with SysOp duties.  You can then give users access to only 
those commands that they are required to perform their tasks.  The rest of 
the commands can have higher security levels assigned to them to prevent 
unauthorized access.

Sysop Commands

Throughout PCBoard there are certain operational characteristics that were 
designed for SysOp use.  For example, there are subcommands available at the 
End of Message Command prompt that will enable a user to COPY or MOVE the 
current message to a new conference.  Obviously, you do not want all users to 
have this capability.  The security levels required to use functions/commands 
like the previous example are controlled on this screen.

Sysop Level (for Sysop Menu and F1-Temp-Sysop Upgrade)

The value that you enter in this field determines the minimum security level 
that constitutes a user being seen as a SysOp. For example, if you enter 100 
in this field, any user with a security level of 100 or higher will be seen 
as a SysOp by PCBoard.  This means that these users will see the SysOp menu 
at the conference command prompt instead of the normal user menu. Just 
because a user is seen as a SysOp does not mean that they have free reign on 
your system.  Remember that you can control the security level required to 
execute virtually all of the functions and commands.

In addition, The security level that you enter in this field will be given to 
the user under the following circumstances.

You temporarily upgrade the access of a user that is online by using the F1 
keyboard command.  This new security level will only be in effect for the 
duration of the call.  When the user calls in the next time, their old 
security level will be used.

There is a conference flag (C) which can be set in the user record which 
designates a user as a conference SysOp.  If this flag is set in a conference 
that you user joins, their security level will be upgraded to the SysOp 
security level.  This security level change will be in effect while the 
caller is in the conference where they are designated as a conference SysOp. 
When they leave the conference, their access will be returned to normal.

Level Needed to Read All Comments

In this field, enter the security level that is required for a user to be 
able to read comments that are left to the SysOp. Comments are seen as any 
messages that are left by users using the C user command.  Because comments 
are assumed to be of the highest security nature, a user who meets the 
security level requirements of this field may also read any message on the 
system.

Level Needed to Read All Mail Except Comments

The security level that you enter in this field will be used to determine if 
a user may read private mail that is not from or to the current user.  If a 
user has a security level that is equal to or greater than the level that is 
entered in this field then they may read any private mail with the exception 
of comments to the SysOp.  The level needed to read comments is determined by 
the previous field on the screen.

Level Needed to Copy or Move Messages Between Areas

Sometimes it is extremely useful to be able to move or copy a message to a 
new conference.  However, you do not want everyone to have this capability 
for obvious reasons.  In order for a user to have the capability of moving or 
copying a message to a new conference, they must have a security level equal 
to or greater than the value that you enter in this field.

Level Needed to Enter @-Variables in Message Base

With the exception of @HANGUP@ and @DELAY:nn@, all macros can be entered in a 
message and displayed when viewing the message. For this reason, you may not 
want all callers to have this capability.  For a user to be able to enter all 
@ macros such as @USER@ and @MORE@ they must have a security level equal to 
or greater than the value you enter in this field.

NOTE:  All users, may enter @X color codes in their messages
regardless of the security level you enter for this field.

Level Needed to Edit Any Message in the Message Base

There are two settings in PCBSetup that will determine if a user will be able 
to edit a message.  This setting controls whether or not a user can edit any 
message they can read regardless if it was entered by them.  There is also a 
setting in PCBSetup | Security Levels | User Levels which controls the 
security level required for a user to edit messages they have left.  
Obviously, you are going to want to set the security level required to edit 
any message higher than the level required to edit the user's own messages as 
it follows the rules of common sense.

In order for a user to edit any message that they can read, they need to have 
a security level that is greater than or equal to the value you enter in the 
field on this screen.  The ability to edit any message is a some-what 
powerful function, because you can make it look like people said something in 
a message that they really did not.  Remember, to edit a message you type 
EDIT at the End of Message Command prompt.

Level Needed to NOT Update Msg Read Status (R O cmd)

The R O user command enables you to read messages without having your last 
message read pointer updated.  This is quite useful for skimming through the 
message base because you can spend more time reading the messages at a later 
time.  All of this is possible because when using this command, your last 
message read pointers are not updated.

This particular field will control whether or not PCBoard should avoid 
marking the message as having been read when you are reading messages in read 
only mode.  You may not want all callers to be able to have this ability and 
thus defeat your ability to tell if they have read their messages yet.  
Setting the security level here outside the reach of your callers will keep 
them from using this capability.

Level Needed to Use the BROADCAST Command

The broadcast command is used to send a one line message to a user on another 
node (or all nodes).  In order for the user to be able to use the BR user 
command they must have a security level that is equal to or greater than the 
value that you enter in this field.

Level Needed to View the Private Upload Directory

The value you enter in this field will control whether or not a user can view 
the private upload directory of the current conference while logged into the 
system.  If the security level of the caller is greater than or equal to the 
value entered, they will be allowed to view the private upload directory.  
When logged into the system, you can view file directories using the F user 
command.  To view the private upload directory of the current conference, 
enter P at the directory prompt number.

Level Needed to Enter Generic Messages (@USER@)

When addressing a message, you can address it to @USER@, @##@ or @##-##@ 
(where ## is a security level)  to make it appear that the single message is 
a personal message for each individual user.  All of these messages are 
referred to as generic messages because one single message can appear to be a 
personal message for every user on your system.

The advantage of this is that a personal message will get more attention from 
the user than a message that is addressed to ALL. The disadvantage to using 
this method is that it can be obnoxious if used too frequently.  You can 
control what users will be able to enter generic messages by entering the 
required security level to enter these messages in the field on this screen.

Level Needed to Edit Message Headers

The security level entered in this field will determine whether or not a user 
will be able to edit additional information of the message header by entering 
E at the End of Message Command prompt.  The ability to edit the message 
header information gives you the ability to  perform such operations as 
re-addressing the message, changing the security on the message, changing the 
FROM field, and more.

Level Needed to Protect/Unprotect a Message

At the End of Message Command prompt, you can enter U to make a message 
public or P to make a message private.  The value you enter in this field 
will set the security level that is required for a user to be able to enter 
these commands.

Level Needed to Overwrite Files on Uploads

When a file already exists on the system, PCBoard will not allow a user to 
upload the same file.  A user that has a security level equal to or greater 
than the value entered in this field can choose to:

* Remove the existing file
* Continue with the upload (leaving both the old and new files online)
* Abort the upload.

Level Needed to Set the Pack-Out Date on Messages

When entering a message, you can set the message security to D if you have 
sufficient security.  This will enable you to set a date when the message you 
are about to enter will be automatically removed from the message base.  This 
would be useful if whatever message you are entering is date sensitive. For 
example, if you offering a special subscription rate until July 1, 1994, you 
may want to set the pack-out date of the message to July 2, 1994 so that 
people logging in after the first will not see the message.

Level Needed to See All Return Receipt Messages

Normally a Return Receipt is useful only to the person that requested the 
return receipt.  With this in mind, PCBoard will normally not show the Return 
Receipt to other users, not even the SysOp.  In order to see return receipts 
that belong to others, you must have a security level equal to or greater 
than the level specified in this field.

User Commands

Security Levels Required

The top portion of this screen is split into two columns.  These two columns 
list most of the user commands that are available inside of PCBoard.  Next to 
each command description is a field. In each field, enter the minimum 
security level that is required to execute the command.  If the user does not 
have sufficient security, then the user will receive a notice stating that 
the command is not available.  In each field, you can enter any value between 
0 and 255.

The rest of the commands (that are not listed) will be controlled by one of 
those that are listed.  For example, the FLAG command can be used if the D 
command is accessible to the user.  This makes sense, because the FLAG 
command simply marks files for download.  If the user is not capable of 
downloading files, you do not want them flagging files.  On this screen you 
will also see four other fields you can define the security level for.  

Level Required for BATCH File Transfers

In order for a user to transfer more than one file at a time, they must have 
a security level that meets or exceeds the value you enter in this field.  
When batch transfers are disabled, a user may only  upload or download a 
single file at a time.

Level Required to EDIT Your Own Messages

In this field, enter the security level that is required for a user to be 
able to edit the contents of messages they have left on the system.  Messages 
are edited by typing EDIT at the End of Message Command prompt.

Users may find that editing their messages would be useful when carrier is 
lost while entering their message, or if they discover a spelling/grammatical 
error after saving the message. If you do not want to let your users edit 
their own messages, set this value to a high security level.

Level Given to Users Who Agree to Register

This field will enable you to determine what security level new users who 
agree to register on your system will be assigned. After the NEWUSER file is 
displayed, PCBoard asks the new user if they would like to register on the 
system.  If they agree to register, they will be assigned the security level 
you enter in this field.

Level Given to Users Who Refuse to Register

If a new user decides not to register on your system, they will be given the 
security level that you enter in this field.  By refusing to register, 
PCBoard is going to allow the user to look around and will not create a user 
record because they chose not to register.

You can immediately log the user off of the system if they refuse to register 
by assigning them a security level of 0.  The security level of 0 will tell 
PCBoard to inform the user that they are being logged off because they 
refused to register.

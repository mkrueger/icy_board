System Manager, as the name implies, is a utility designed to help you manage 
your system.  Not only can you make global changes to the users file, but you 
can also access other frequently used utilities such as PCBSetup and 
PCBFiler.


There are three ways that you can access System Manager:

From the call waiting screen, select PCBSysMgr.

While logged in locally (not with the /LOCALON switch for PCBoard), you can 
press ALT-S.

From the DOS prompt you can load PCBSM.EXE.  If a PCBOARD.DAT file cannot be 
found in the current directory and you have not used the /FILE command line 
parameter, you will receive an error message stating that PCBOARD.DAT could 
not be found.


Once System Manager is loaded, you will see the Main Menu.  The various 
function of system manager are available from these menu options.  To select 
a particular option, press the letter at the beginning of the line, or move 
the currently highlighted option using the cursor keys and press ENTER to 
select the option.  If you make a mistake, you can always use the ESC to go 
back to the previous menu.

This section will describe each menu item in detail including any sub-menus.  
In addition, the command line parameters for System Manager are described in 
detailed at the end of this chapter.

Users File Maintenance

This is the menu option that you probably use most frequently. Once you 
select it, you will see you have an entire new menu to select from.  These 
new menu options give you the ability to edit an individual user record, 
register ranges of users in conferences, sort the users file, pack the users 
file, etc.

Editing A User Record

When you select this menu option, you will see user record number one on your 
system.

On the left hand screen is a limited number of fields that you can edit.  On 
the right is a list of keyboard commands you can use to jump to another 
record, add a new user, etc.  This is called the short form.

User Record Forms

PCBoard stores a lot of information about each user.  Because all of this 
information cannot fit on one screen, PCBoard has multiple views which you 
can switch between to edit various information about each user.  To switch 
between views, use the F2 and F3 keys.  Pressing F2 will move forward one 
screen or form, and pressing F3 will switch to the previous form.

The default view is called the Short Form.  When this form is active, you can 
edit the bare essential information about each user.  You can edit the 
following information when the short form is active.


	Security	The normal security level that is assigned to the user.

        Reg Ex Date     If subscription mode is active, this is the date 
                        which the user's subscription will expire on the 
                        system.

        Expired Sec     When subscription mode is active and a user is 
                        expired.  The expired security level will be used in 
                        stead of the normal security level.  This field shows 
                        you the security level of the user when their 
                        subscription has expired.

        Delete User     Mark the current user for deletion.  You are asked to 
                        confirm your choice before the record will be marked.  
                        The actual record is not deleted until the next time 
                        you pack the users file.

        Comment 1       This is the response the user enters to PCBTEXT 
                        record #2 when creating a new account on the system.

        Comment 2       This comment field is for your use only.  You can 
                        enter a brief comment about the user without having 
                        to worry about it being viewable by the user.

The next view that is available by pressing F2 is called the Long
Form.  This is the view that you will use to edit a majority of
the information about each user.  You can edit number of bytes
transferred, messages left, username, password, etc.  The
following describes each of the fields:

        Name            Each person that logs into your system must use a 
                        user name. Most commonly this will be the name of the 
                        caller.  This name simply identifies the caller.

        City            The city or location information entered when creating a new 
                        account on the system.

	B/D Phone	The business or data phone entered when creating a
                        new account on the system.

        H/V Phone       The home or voice phone number entered when creating 
                        a new account.

        Password        Stores the password selected for logging into the 
                        system.  Each user must know their password in order 
                        to log into the system.  If this field is blank, the 
                        user will not be prompted for a password at login.

	Security	The normal security level that is assigned to the user.

        Expert          This field will contain a Y if the user wishes to 
                        default to expert mode at login.  Otherwise, this 
                        field will show an N which means the user will 
                        default to novice mode.

        Protocol        Stores the default protocol the user wishes to use 
                        for file transfers.  This question is asked when a 
                        new user logs in, but it may also be changed using 
                        the T user command.

        Page Len        In order to help control the display of information, 
                        PCBoard will use a More? prompt when the screen fills 
                        up on the caller's screen.  In this field, the height 
                        of the caller's screen should be entered.  For most 
                        users, this should be either 22 or 23.  If you set 
                        the value in this field to 0, PCBoard will send data 
                        in non-stop mode.  The user may change this value 
                        with the P user command.

        Reg Ex Date     If subscription mode is active, this is the date 
                        which the user's subscription will expire on the 
                        system.

        Expired Sec     If a user's subscription has expired, the expired 
                        security level will be assigned at login instead of 
                        the normal security level.  This field shows the 
                        expired security level assigned to the user.

        Msg Clear       This field will contain a Y if the user wishes to 
                        clear the screen before a new message is displayed on 
                        the screen.  If this field contains an N, the screen 
                        will not be cleared between messages.

        Last in         The conference number the user was in when 
                        disconnected last.  If you have any conference 
                        defined as auto-rejoin, this field becomes of great 
                        importance.  For example, a 3 in this field will mean 
                        the user logged off while in conference 3.  The next 
                        time the user logs in, PCBoard will check to see if 
                        conference 3 is defined as an auto-rejoin conference.  
                        If so, the user will be placed back in conference 3.

        Delete User     Mark the current user for deletion.  You are asked to 
                        confirm your choice before the record will be marked.  
                        The actual record is not deleted until the next time 
                        you pack the users file.

        Comment 1       This is the response that the user entered to PCBTEXT 
                        record #2 when creating a new account.

        Comment 2       This comment field is for your use only.  You can 
                        enter a brief comment about the user.  The user will 
                        not be able to view the contents of this field.

        Last DIR ListingPCBoard keeps track of the latest valid file date 
                        that you have seen when viewing file directories.  
                        This field is used for two purposes.  1)  For new 
                        file scans to determine what the default scan date 
                        should be.  2)  While viewing file directories * 
                        (asterisks) will be placed by any files which are new 
                        to the caller.

        Last Date On    Stores the last date the user logged into the system.

        Last Time On    Stores the last time the user logged into the system.

        Elapsed Time On Contains the total amount of time that was spent on 
                        the last date the user called on the system.  If the 
                        last date the user called is equal to the current 
                        date, this field contains how much time the user has 
                        spent for the current day.

        Number Times On The number of times this user has successfully logged 
                        into your system.

        Number Uploads  The total number of files this user has uploaded to 
                        your system.

        Number DownloadsThe total number of files this user has downloaded 
                        from your system.

        Daily Download  Contains the total number of bytes this user 
                        downloaded the last date on the system.  If the last 
                        date on is equal to today's date, the value of this 
                        field will reflect the total number of bytes 
                        downloaded today.  If you see a negative value in 
                        this field, more bytes have been uploaded than 
                        downloaded.  In essence, the user has a byte credit.  

        Total Upload    This field displays the total number of bytes the 
                        user has uploaded to your system.

        Total Download  Displays the total number of bytes the user has 
                        downloaded from your system.

	Messages Read	The total number of messages the user has read.

	Messages Left	The total number of messages the user has entered.

        Full Scrn EditorThis field will contain either Y, N, or A.  A Y means 
                        the full-screen editor will always be used for 
                        entering messages.  An N signifies that the line 
                        editor will be used for entering messages.  Finally, 
                        an A means the user will be asked if they wish to use 
                        the full-screen editor each time they leave a 
                        message.  The user may change this default with the W 
                        user command.

        79-Column EditorIf this field contains a Y, both the line and 
                        full-screen editor will use 79 character-wide lines 
                        when entering messages.  If an N is specified, the 
                        default will be 72 characters instead.

        Scroll Long MsgsThis field may contain either Y or N.  If this field 
                        contains a Y, the message header will scroll off of 
                        the screen if the message requires more than one 
                        screen full to display.  If this field contains an N, 
                        the message header will be fixed at the top of the 
                        screen with the message body being displayed 
                        underneath it.

        Long Headers    If this field contains a Y, long message headers will 
                        be used.  Otherwise the short message headers will be 
                        used. See the R user command for more information on 
                        the difference between long and short message 
                        headers.

        Chat Status     PCBoard will remember the chat status of the caller.  
                        This means that if a caller has made themselves 
                        unavailable for group chat using the CHAT;U command, 
                        this field will contain a U to reflect that the user 
                        was unavailable.  When the user logs into the system 
                        the next time, the chat status from their previous 
                        call will be reinstated.


You can control the conference specific information for each particular user 
from the Conference View.  Primarily you will register users in conferences 
from this view, but you can accomplish other tasks as well.

You will notice this screen is split into two lists with 15 conferences 
listed in each list.  Within each list is four columns.  The first column 
displays the conference number, the next displays the name of the conference.  
The last two columns are fields you can actually edit.  The first field you 
can edit is the flags field, the last column in each list keeps track of the 
last message that each user read in each conference.

To move between the various fields on the screen, you can use down arrow, up 
arrow, TAB, or SHIFT-TAB.  If you have more than 30 conferences, use PgUp, 
and PgDn to move forward or back 30 conferences at a time.

There are five possible flags you can set for each conference. Each flag will 
specify what type of access the user has to the conference the flags are 
being set for.  Each flag is described in detail below:

        R       Register.  This flag is used to control the ability of a user 
                to join a conference.  The main use of this flag is to 
                control who will have access to private conferences you 
                create.  A user may not join a private conference unless they 
                have an R flag in that conference.  You do not need to use 
                this flag for public conferences unless you want to give 
                access to the conference even if the user does not have 
                sufficient security to join the conference.

        X       Expired.  When used with the R flag, the user will continue 
                to have access to the conference even when their subscription 
                has expired.  Subscription mode (PCBSetup | Subscriptions) 
                must be enabled or this flag will have no effect.

        S       Selected.  Even though there may be several conferences 
                defined on your system, only a few of those conferences may 
                interest the user.  Using the SELECT user command, users may 
                select those conferences which are of interest to them.  
                There are subcommands for all of the mail reading or scanning 
                commands which permit users to scan either all conferences 
                they can access or only those conferences selected by the 
                user.  For example, R;S;ALL will read new mail in all 
                conferences the user can join whereas R;S;A will read mail 
                only in selected conferences.

        C       Conference SysOp.  If you wish to give a user what you have 
                defined as SysOp security level (PCBSetup | Security Levels | 
                Sysop Commands) when the conference is joined, use this flag. 
                When the user joins another conference, the security level is 
                changed back to the original security level.

        L       Locked Out.  If this flag is set, the user will not be able 
                to join the conference under any circumstances.  When you 
                specify the X flag without an R flag, the X flag will be 
                translated to an L flag thereby locking the user out of the 
                conference.


The only other edit field on this screen is the last message read field.  In 
this field, PCBoard keeps track of the last message the user has read in each 
conference.  If you need to, you can edit the last message read in any 
conference for any user.

The rest of the views are only active when you install a PSA. Each PSA has a 
separate screen which you can view information about each PSA.  The following 
describes each of the PSA screens:


If you have the Alias PSA installed, the next screen will contain the alias 
the user has selected to use.  Unless you have given the user the ability to 
edit the alias choosen (PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control) 
the only way that the alias can be changed is while you are viewing the Alias 
Form.

By installing the Full Address PSA you will enable the Address Form screen.  
From this screen, you can edit the fields that make up the user's address.  
You will notice that this screen lists the more popular components that make 
up a mailing address such as street address, city, state, etc.

If you install the Password Changing PSA, the Password From will also be 
active when editing a user record.  The following fields are active in this 
form:

        Previous Password       Lists the most recently used passwords.  A 
                                password may not be used if it is listed in 
                                one of these fields. Of course, each password 
                                will eventually be removed as it no longer 
                                becomes one of the three most recently used 
                                passwords.

        Last Change Date        The date when the password was last changed 
                                by the user.

        # of times Changed      Displays the total number of times the 
                                password has been changed.  Multiple changes 
                                on the same day will not be recorded.

        Expiration Date         The date at which the current password will 
                                expire.  If the user changes the password 
                                before the expiration date, the date will be 
                                adjusted for the new expiration date.


If you have installed the Verification PSA, the Verification Form will be 
active.  This screen is very simple in design because there is only one field 
you cay edit.  This field contains the information that the user entered as 
verification information when logging in as a new user.  This information can 
be used by you as an additional piece of secret information to identify the 
caller.  Considering that the caller may not view or edit this information 
once it has been entered, it should be relatively safe to assume that if the 
user knows this information that they are the original caller.


If you have installed the Caller Statistics PSA, the Statistics Form will be 
active.  This form stores various statistics about the caller.  The following 
describes each field:


        First Date On           This date will be equal to the date the user 
                                first logged into your system or the date you 
                                added the Caller Statistics PSA (if they 
                                already had an account).

        Last Date On            The last date the user logged into your 
                                system. You can also see this date on the 
                                Long Form screen.

        Num Times On            The total number of times this user has 
                                accessed your system.  This information is 
                                also available on the Long Form screen.

        # Times Paged SysOp     This field will record the total number of 
                                times this user has paged the sysop to chat.  
                                It does not matter if the page was answered 
                                or not -- all attempts are recorded.

        # Times Group Chat      If a user uses group chat to chat with others 
                                on the system, the total number of chat 
                                sessions the user has participated will be 
                                recorded in this field.  SysOp chats are not 
                                included in this total.

        # Comments to Sysop     This field records the total number of 
                                comments the user has left to the SysOp using 
                                the C user command.  If the user begins a 
                                comment, but aborts the message, it does not 
                                count as a comment to the sysop.

        # Messages Left         For those users that are more active in the 
                                message base, this field will store the total 
                                number of messages the user has entered.  You 
                                should be aware that while PCBoard may update 
                                this statistic, off-line mail reading doors 
                                may not.

        # Messages Read         Displays the total number of messages the 
                                user has read on your system.  While PCBoard 
                                will update this field, some off-line mail 
                                door programs may not.

        # Security Violation    You can easily see who may be trying to

                                by watching this field.  It will total up the 
                                number of times a user has attempted to 
                                access a command which requires a higher 
                                security level.

        # Un-Reg Conf Atmpt.    Records the total number of attempts made to

                                registered to join.

        # Password Failures     Displays the number of times the wrong 
                                password was used at login.  If you keep tabs 
                                on this statistic, you may be able to catch 
                                someone who is trying to hack into an account 
                                on your system.

        # Dnld Limit Reached    Anytime a user exceeds their defined ratio, 
                                daily bytes, or total bytes / files allotted, 
                                the count in this field will increase by 1.

        # Dnld File Not Fnd.    If the user attempts to download a file, but 
                                the filename could not be found on disk, it 
                                will be recorded in this field.  

        # Upld Verify Failed    After uploading a file, PCBoard will test the 
                                file via PCBTEST.BAT unless you have disabled 
                                upload testing.  If the file uploaded fails 
                                the integrity tests, it will be recorded in 
                                this field.

        # Times On at 300       Displays the total number of times the user 
                                connected at 300 bps.

        # Times On at 1200      Displays the total number of times the user 
                                connected at 1200 bps.

        # Times On at 2400      Displays the total number of times the user 
                                connected at 2400 bps.

        # Times On at 9600      Displays the total number of times the user 
                                connected at 4800, 7200 or 9600 bps.  All 
                                three speeds are shown in this field, because 
                                they are all only possible with 9600 bps 
                                modems.

        # Times On at 14400+    Displays the total number of times the user 
                                connected at 12000 bps or higher.  The reason 
                                12000 bps is included in this statistic is 
                                because it is a fall-back speed for 14400 
                                connections.

Finally, the last PSA screen is called Caller Notes and is only active when 
the Caller Notes PSA has been installed.  You are given 5 lines of 50 
characters which you may enter information to remember about the caller.   
The caller is not able to edit or view the information contained in these 
notes.

Keyboard Commands

While you are editing a user record, there are several keyboard commands you 
may use to perform functions such as printing the current user record, 
jumping to another record, deleting the current record, etc.  The following 
details each keyboard command that is available while editing a user record.


        PgUp    Move backward one user record.  If you are at user record 
                number one, you will go to the last record in your users 
                file.

        PgDn    Move forward one user record.  If you are at the last record 
                in the users file, record number one will be the new record  
                you are editing.

      CTRL-PgUp Move backward twenty user records.  When you need to move 
                several records at a time, you can use this keyboard command 
                which will go backwards 20 records at a time.

      CTRL-PgDn Move forward twenty user records.  When you use this keyboard 
                command you will advance 20 records at a time.

        ALT-A   Add a user.  Enables you to add a new record to your users
                file.  You can then manually fill in all of the user 
                information.

        ALT-B   Jump to the last user record.  Moves you to the last record 
                in the users file.  Since new users are added to the end of 
                the users file, this keyboard command provides an easy method 
                to access the records of your newest callers.
                        
        ALT-D   Delete current user.  Marks the current user for deletion. 
                You will be asked to confirm your request to delete the 
                current record.  If you continue, the security level will be 
                reduced to 0 and the record will be marked for deletion.  The 
                actual record will not be deleted until you pack the users 
                file.  To undelete the record, simply change the answer to 
                Delete User in the Long Form.

        ALT-E   Located expired security level.  Locates the first user in 
                the users file who has an expired security level equal to the 
                one you specify.  If you want to search for other users who 
                have the same security level, use the ALT-R keyboard command.

        ALT-F   Find a user name.  Enables you to search for a particular 
                user record.  When prompted, enter the full name of the user 
                you wish to search for.  If the user could not be found, you 
                will be asked if you would like to perform a sound alike 
                search. PCBoard will attempt to find names which sound like 
                the name you typed in.  If no matches can be found, you will 
                be returned to the last record you were editing.

        ALT-J   Jump to a record number.  If you want to jump to a specific 
                user record number, use this keyboard command.  You will be 
                asked for the record number you wish to jump to.  You can see 
                the range of users on your system by looking at the upper 
                right hand side of the screen.  There you will find Record # 
                of #.  If you enter a value that is out of range of your 
                users file, your request will be ignored.

        ALT-L   Locate a security level.  When you need to search for a 
                particular security level, use this keyboard command.  You 
                will be asked for the security level you wish to search for.  
                Once you enter the security level to search for, PCBoard will 
                take you to the first record in the users file that matches 
                the security level.  You can then use ALT-R to search for 
                additional matches throughout the users file.

        ALT-O   Locate deleted user.  This keyboard command will locate the 
                first record in your users file that is marked for deletion. 
                This is useful when you have marked a record for deletion but 
                then decide not to delete the record.  Of course, if you have 
                already packed the users file, there is no way to recover the 
                deleted user record.  As with other searches, ALT-R will find 
                additional records that have been marked for deletion.

        ALT-P   Print current user record.  The current user record will be 
                printed.  The format of the printout is identical to the 
                format displayed by the 7 SysOp command.  See the SysOp 
                Commands section in the PCBoard Commands chapter of this 
                manual for further details.

        ALT-R   Repeat last search.  When you use a keyboard command that 
                searches the users file, you can repeat the search (looking 
                for additional matches) by using this keyboard command.  If 
                no additional matches are found, you will be returned to the 
                previous user record you were editing.

        ALT-S   Search for text. This keyboard command allows you to search 
                all of the data stored in the users record (and optionally 
                the PSA information) for the text you specify, excluding 
                dates, times, and numerical values which are stored in a 
                special format on disk.
                       
        ALT-T   Goto first record.  Takes you to the first record in the 
                users file (the SysOp record).

Sorting Users

If you prefer to have the users in your system sorted in a particular manner, 
select this menu option from the Main Menu of System Manager.  For example, 
some SysOps prefer to have their users sorted by security level in descending 
order so users with the highest security levels are at the beginning of the 
users file.  It all depends on your personal preference.  One thing to 
remember is the first record in your users file will never be included in the 
sorts you perform because it is considered to be the SysOp record and has 
special privileges.  You can choose to do a single or a multiple field sort.

Single Field Sorts

Single field sorts are most useful when you want to sort users by a field 
which does not commonly have duplicates.  For example, you can sort by user 
name and since there cannot be duplicate names on your system.  The screen on 
the following page shows the sorts you can perform.

Once you have selected your sort method, you will be asked if you wish to 
sort in reverse order.  Reverse order means that the sort will be done in 
descending order.  In the case of sorting by names, those that begin with Z 
will be at the top while names that begin with A will be at the end of the 
users file.


System Manager will now attempt to lock the users file for exclusive access 
so that it may begin sorting the users file. If you do not have all nodes 
down, you will see a sharing violation message.  This message means that 
System Manager cannot gain exclusive access to the users file which it needs 
in order to resort the file.  Make sure all nodes are down and no other 
programs are accessing the users file before you continue.


Multiple Field Sorts

Multiple field sorts enable you to sort by items such as security, number of 
times on the system, ratios, and more.  All of these fields could easily 
contain duplicates when sorted, which presents a problem. If there are 
duplicates, how should the duplicate files be sorted (if at all)?  You will 
notice that with multiple field sorts, it will first sort by the primary 
field, such as security level, and then use the user name as a secondary 
sort.


The following screen shows the sorts you can perform:


Once you have selected your sort method, you will be asked if you wish to 
sort the primary key in reverse order.  Reverse order means that the sort 
will be done in descending order.  The primary key is the main sorting 
method.  For example, if you select Security Level then Name from the menu, 
the primary key is the Security Level and the secondary key is Name.  You 
will also be asked if you wish to sort the secondary key in reverse order.

As an example, if you select Security Level then Name from the menu and 
choose to sort the primary key in reverse order but the secondary key in the 
normal order, the following will happen:


Your users will be sorted by security level -- those with the highest 
security level will be at the beginning of your user file.

If you have more than one user with the same security level, the order that 
users are listed with the same security level will be determined 
alphabetically by the user name.

Once you have selected your sort criteria, System Manager will attempt to 
lock the users file for exclusive access so it may begin sorting the users 
file.  If you do not have all nodes down, you will see a sharing violation 
message.  This message means that System  Manager cannot gain exclusive 
access to the users file which it needs in order to resort the file.  Make 
sure all nodes are down and no other programs are accessing the users file 
before you continue.


Packing The Users File

When you pack your users file, you can accomplish the following:


Physically remove any records marked for deletion.  Once a record has been 
packed out, it is permanently deleted and cannot be undeleted.

Remove inactive users from your system to help conserve disk space.

Make sure your USERS file is correctly in-sync with your USERS.INF.


When you select the option to pack your users, you will see the screen on the 
following page.


You will notice that the pack criteria screen is divided into two logical 
sections -- removal and keep criteria.  You can set the criteria you want to 
remove user records from and you may also set the criteria to keep a user 
record.  The keep criteria always takes precedence over the removal criteria.

If you choose to accept the default values then only the following will 
happen:

Any users marked for deletion will be physically removed from the system.

The USERS.INF is checked to make sure it is in sync with the
USERS file.


Criteria For Removing Records

This section of the screen gives you the ability to specify which users will 
be removed from the users file when the file is packed.  There are four 
options you may specify for removing a user record:

Remove Users that are Deleted or 'LOCKED OUT':  When this field is set to Y , 
any record that has a security level of 0 or has been marked for deletion 
will be deleted out of your users file. Remember, there is an option to keep 
locked out users (those with a security level of 0 but not marked for 
deletion) and the criteria for keeping a record takes precedence.


Remove Users who have not been on for XXXX days:  If you want to pack out 
inactive users on a regular basis, you will most likely use this option.  If 
you enter 45 in this field, every user who does not meet the keep criteria 
will be deleted from the users file if they have not called your system 
within the last 45 days.  If you do this on a regular basis, you can be sure 
only active users are stored in your users files.  The default number of days 
is 9999 which disables this option.

Remove Users who have not been on since:  You may also choose to pack users 
out of your system by the last date they logged into the system.  For 
example, you can choose to delete anyone who has not called your system since 
01-01-93 by entering that date in this field.  The default date is 01-01-80 
(the beginning of time for the PC) which disables this option.


Remove Users whose Reg. Exp. Date is older than:  If you run with 
subscription mode enabled, you may find it useful to be able to remove those 
accounts which have been expired for quite some time.  The date you enter in 
this field will be compared against the expiration date in each user record.  
If the expiration date in the user record is older than the date entered, the 
user record will be removed.   The default date is 00-00-00 which disables 
this option.

Criteria For Keeping User Record

This section of the screen gives you the ability to specify the criteria for 
keeping a user record when packing.  The criteria for keeping a record takes 
precedence over removal criteria. This means that even if a user record would 
be removed, it will not be removed if it meets the criteria for keeping.  The 
following two options are available:

Keep Users with security greater than or equal to:  Any user who has a 
security level equal to or greater than the security level specified will not 
be packed out of the user file.  This is useful for making sure everyone 
above a particular security level is not packed out.  For example, if you 
setup your system so everyone above security level 100 are SysOps, you may 
want to specify 100 in this field.

Keep Users that are 'LOCKED OUT':  A Y in this field will retain user records 
which have been marked as locked out (security level of 0 but not marked for 
deletion).  As an example of why you may want to keep these records, suppose 
you have a user who has consistently violated system rules and has been 
locked out. Keeping the user record prevents this user from accessing your 
system again with the same user name and information. 

Performing The Pack

One last option you can specify is whether you wish to print out the users 
that are deleted during the pack.  If you choose to print deleted records, 
you will have a record of those users who are deleted.  In each record, most 
of the user information will be printed, so you may later re-enter a user 
whom you have deleted.  The information is identical to the information 
displayed by using the 7 SysOp command.  See the PCBoard Commands chapter of 
this manual for further information.

Once you have chosen whether or not to print the deleted records, press PgDn 
to begin the packing process.  Because packing will cause a global change to 
the users file, System Manager requires exclusive access to both your USERS 
and USERS.INF files.  This means no other nodes should be online.  System 
Manager does, however, provide an option which allows you to pack the users 
file while users are online.

The difference between packing offline and online is the fact that users who 
are currently online or were online when the process began will not be 
affected by the pack criteria you specify.  When possible, it is always best 
to do a normal pack with no nodes online.


NOTE:  If you have installed the Alias PSA, System Manager will not allow you 
to perform an online pack.

Print Users File

Using this menu option, you can print the entire users file or only a portion 
by specifying the starting and ending user records to print. There are three 
fields that determine which records will be printed.

Starting Record:  The starting record number to print.  The default is 1 
which will begin printing with the first record in the users file.

Ending Record:  The last record number you wish to print.  The default is the 
last record number in your users record.  The number you enter in this field 
must be larger than the number entered as the starting record or your print 
request will be aborted.

Exp. users Only:  Setting this option to Y means that only users in the 
specified range whose expiration date is earlier than today's date will be 
printed.  Setting this option to N will print all users regardless of their 
expiration date.

You may pick from three different formats for printing the users file.  The 
information will be sent to the printer you defined in System Manager; all 
reports will be less than 80 characters in width and will include form feed 
codes.  Each printing form is described in detail:

Short Form

The short form will print one user per line.  On each line the following 
information will be printed:


Name
City/State
Security Level
Business / Data Phone
Home / Voice Phone

Long Form

Each record printed in this style will contain the same information shown via 
the 7 SysOp command.  For information on this format, refer to the PCBoard 
Commands chapter of this manual.

Reg. Expiration Form

Like the short form, this form will print one user per line. The information 
printed in this form is designed to help you easily locate users whose 
subscription has expired or is about to expire.  The following information 
about each user is printed:


Name
Business / Data Phone
Home / Voice Phone
Security
Expiration Date
Expiration Info - If the user has expired  then (EXPIRED) will be printed.  
If the user is within the warning period you have specified for subscriptions 
(PCBSetup | Subscription), the number of days until the user expires will be 
printed. Otherwise, this area of the report will be blank.


Make Users File Index

In general, both PCBoard and System Manager take care of the users index 
files automatically.  If for some reason you suspect the indexes are out of 
sync, use this selection to recreate all user index files.

When your user index files are out of sync with the users files, you may 
experience a problem when a user attempts to login, types in the correct 
password, but PCBoard will report that the password is incorrect.  It does 
not hurt to recreate the index files and it does not take very long.  If you 
get reports such as the one described previously, re-index your users files.

Adjust Security Levels

This selection brings up a sub-menu allowing you to globally adjust security 
levels in the users file according to the upload/download ratio, their number 
of uploads or even just to convert one range of security levels to a new 
security level.

You can also initialize globally all upload/download counters and change 
security levels a user's real security level to equal the expired security 
level.

The screen on the following page displays the security level adjustments you 
can perform.


Adjust by Ranges

Use this menu option to assign a new security level to a group of users 
within a specified security level range.


For example, if you need to change every user with a security level of 35 to 
a security level of 33, enter the following:


Change users whose security is greater than or equal to : 35
      and whose security level is less than or equal to : 35

To a new security level of :  33

You may need to consolidate a range of security levels into one single 
security level.  This can be done with the menu option very easily.  To 
change every user with a security level between 20 and 29 to security level 
20, enter the following:


Change users whose security is greater than or equal to : 20
      and whose security level is less than or equal to : 29

To a new security level of :  20


Adjust by Ranges (Expired)

This menu option is identical to Adjust by Ranges with one major exception:  
Instead of modifying the actual security level of the user, only the expired 
security level is modified.  

As an example,  if you need to change every user who has an expired security 
level of 45 to reflect a new expired security level of 55, enter the 
following:


Change users whose security is greater than or equal to : 45
      and whose security level is less than or equal to : 45

To a new security level of :  55

You may need to consolidate a range of expired security levels into one 
single expired security level.  To change every user with an expired security 
level between 30 and 49 to an expired security level of 25, enter the 
following:


Change users whose security is greater than or equal to : 30
      and whose security level is less than or equal to : 49

To a new security level of :  25


Adjust by Up/Dn File Ratio

This menu option gives you the ability to globally adjust security levels of 
users according to  file ratio of each user.

System Manager will refer to the file ratio table you create to determine 
what security level is assigned based on the user's ratio.  See Create Up/Dn 
File Ratio Table for information about creating the table.

Before you begin, you are asked if you wish to print the users who have their 
security level changed.  If you choose to print the report, it will be sent 
to the printer defined in System Manager.  The report includes:


User name
Number of files uploaded
Number of files downloaded
File ratio
Old security level
New security level


Adjust by Up/Dn Byte Ratio

This menu option gives you the ability to globally adjust security levels of 
users according to the byte ratio of each user.  

System Manager will refer to the byte ratio table you create to determine 
what security level is assigned based on the user's ratio.  See Create Up/Dn 
Byte Ratio Table for information about creating the table.

Before you begin, you are asked if you wish to print the users who have their 
security level changed.  If you choose to print the report, it will be sent 
to the printer defined in System Manager.  The report includes:

User name
Number of bytes uploads
Number of bytes downloads
Byte ratio
Old security level
New security level

Adjust by Number of Uploads

You may also adjust the security level of users based on the number of files 
they have uploaded to the system.  System Manager will reference the table 
created via Create Upload Table. 

Before you begin, you are asked if you wish to print the users who have their 
security level changed.  If you choose to print the report, it will be sent 
to the printer defined in System Manager.  The report includes:


User name
Number of uploads
Old security level
New security level


Adjust by Number of Downloads

You may also adjust the security level of users based on the number of files 
they have downloaded from the system.  System Manager will reference the 
table created via Create Download Table. 

Before you begin, you are asked if you wish to print the users who have their 
security level changed.  If you choose to print that report, it will be sent 
to the printer defined in System Manager.  The report includes:


User name
Number of downloads
Old security level
New security level


Create Up/Dn File Ratio Table

This menu option is the one you want to use to create the table used for 
adjusting security levels by the file ratio of a user.

When you select this menu option, you will see the screen on the following 
page.


Notice that there are two columns where you edit data.  One column is titled 
Ratio and other is titled Security.  Based on the file ratio of the user, a 
new security level will be assigned.


When designing your table, keep in mind how System Manager will read the 
table.  It reads two ratio entries at a time.  If a user falls in-between the 
two ratios, the user will get the security level listed to the right of the 
first ratio.  The following illustrates:

System Manager will continue to search through the table until a match is 
found.  Notice that the key is the ratio.  The user will be assigned a 
security level based on their ratio.  If you are looking to assign a ratio to 
a particular security level, define the ratio in the PWRD file (PCBSetup | 
File Locations | Configuration Files).

Normally a ratio is specified as something like  10:1 (10 to 1). Entering a 
ratio in that manner is cumbersome so an alternate method had to be devised. 
System Manager determines a ratio less than 0 to be a download to upload, 
while a positive ratio number is considered an upload to download ratio.

What is the difference?  A download to upload ratio means more has been 
downloaded than uploaded, while an upload to download ratio means more has 
been uploaded than downloaded.

Rather than limiting you to whole number ratios only (e.g., 25:1) you may 
enter up to the tenths digits (e.g., 25.3:1).  To specify a ratio of 25.3, 
enter either 253 to specify an upload to download ratio or -253 to specify a 
download to upload ratio. Remember that 25 is really 25.0 so you must enter 
it as 250 or -250.  If you enter 25, it will be interpreted as 2.5.

The following are some important items you will want to remember about 
creating your ratio table:

The ratios you enter should be ordered from smallest to greatest.  This means 
you should enter the negative ratio values at the top of your list and your 
positive values at the end of the list.  Your ratio table will automatically 
be sorted before it is saved to disk.

The ratio you enter for the first entry is ignored because it represents the 
absolute largest download:upload ratio.  The security level for the first 
entry is important though, because it is the security level that used when 
System Manager compares the first two entries in your table.

The security level to the right of your last entry in the ratio table will 
only be assigned if the user has a better ratio than the ratio defined on the 
last line.  This means that if your last line is set for a ratio of 50 and a 
security level of 40, the user will only get a security level of 40 if they 
have a ratio that is better than 5 uploads for every download.

A ratio of 0, 10, or -10 implies that uploads are equal to downloads.

Only security levels listed in the security column will be included in ratio 
checking.  This means you can have users that are exempt from being adjusted 
due to their ratio by simply excluding their security in your ratio table 
definition.

As an example, let's assume you want to create a simple ratio table where if 
a user has a download:upload ratio greater than 20:1, a security level of 20 
will be assigned.  In addition, a ratio between 10:1 and 20:1 will result in 
a security level of 30, and a ratio above 10:1 will get a security level of 
40.  To accomplish this, create the following table:

  Ratio       Security
----------    --------
  -9999999          20
      -200          30
      -100          40
         0           0


If you want to set up another ratio, it is very easy to add. Let's say you 
want to give users that have uploaded more than they have downloaded a 
security level of 50.  This can be done simply by adding a new line after the 
-100 line making your table resemble the following:


  Ratio       Security
----------    --------
  -9999999          20
      -200          30
      -100          40
         0          50
         0           0

So you can get a feeling of how System Manager will use your table to assign 
security levels, let's look at three sample users and see how their security 
levels will be adjusted.

Security    : 20
Number Uploads   :     8
Number Downloads :   523

Calculation of this user's ratio reveals it to be about 65.4 downloads for 
every upload, which is expressed in System Manager as -654.  System Manager 
will look at the first two lines in your ratio table:


  -9999999          20
      -200          30

As you can see, this particular user has a ratio in-between these two lines 
so a security level of 20 will be assigned (which the user already has).  The 
next user has the following record:

Security    : 30
Number Uploads   :   353
Number Downloads :   751


This particular user has a ratio that equates to approximately 2.1 downloads 
for every file uploaded.  In System Manager terms this is expressed as -21.  
System Manager will now analyze your ratio table from the top, down to the 
bottom looking for a match:


  -9999999          20
      -200          30


The ratio for this user does not fit between this range so the
next two lines are analyzed.

      -200          30
      -100          40


This user's ratio does not fit between this range either, so the
next two lines are analyzed.

      -100          40
         0          50

Finally, a match.  This user's ratio was -51, which falls within this range.  
Now looking at the security level of the first line, we can see the user will 
receive a security level of 40. This particular user was upgraded from a 
security level of 30 to a new security level of 40 because of the improved 
file ratio.


The last user has the following information:


Security    :  35
Number Uploads   :     7
Number Downloads :    43


This user will not be affected, not because the ratio would leave him at 
security level 35, but rather because security level 35 is not even listed in 
the ratio table.  As stated earlier, security levels not listed in the table 
will not be adjusted due to their ratios.

Create Up/Dn Byte Ratio Table

The only difference between this option and adjusting by file ratio is that 
System Manager will determine the ratio based on bytes uploaded and 
downloaded instead of the number of files transferred.  Everything else about 
byte and file ratios are the same including creating the ratio table.  For 
more information on creating the table, see the previous section.

Create Upload Table

This option gives you the ability to adjust the security level of a user 
based on how many files they have uploaded to the system.  When you select 
this option, you will notice that it looks quite similar to ratio tables.

This table does not try to relate uploads and downloads to one another so you 
may find it easier to setup.  System Manager will simply analyze two lines of 
your table at a time.  If the number of files a user has uploaded falls 
between two entries, the user will be given the appropriate security level as 
shown in the following sample:

As an example, let's assume you creat the following table:

 
 Uploads      Security
----------    --------
         0          15
         1          20
        50          40
         0           0

Until a user uploads a file, the security level will remain 15. A user who 
has uploaded more than one file, but has not yet uploaded 50 files, will 
receive a security level of 20.  If a user has uploaded 50 or more files, a 
security level of 40 will be given.

Create Download Table

The creation and use of this table is identical to the Upload table.  The 
only exception is that the number of files downloaded are checked instead of 
the number of files uploaded. Refer to the previous section for additional 
information.

Change Security to Expired Level

When a user's subscription expires, PCBoard leaves the security level intact 
but will give the user their expired security level at login.  By doing this, 
a user can renew their subscription and you simply have to update their 
expiration date to restore the old security level.

Sometimes, however, you may want to make permanent the expired security level 
of a user whose subscription has expired.  This menu option allows you to 
make this change, adjusting the user's normal security level to match the 
level in the expired security level field.

Before you make this change, PCBoard asks if you wish to print a list of 
users who have their security levels changed.  Answering Y at this prompt 
will cause a report to be printed to the printer defined for System Manager 
to use.  This report includes the following information:


User name
Old security level
New permanent security level (expired security level)
Date of expiration

Before System Manager makes the change, it must verify it is the only 
application accessing the users file.  If it cannot gain exclusive access to 
the users file, you will receive notice that all nodes must be down before 
you can make this change.

Initialize Upld/Dnld Counters

You can use this option to reset or change the upload/download byte and file 
counters for every user on the system.  You can choose any of the following 
options:


Make the upload counter equal to the download counter.
Make the download counter equal to the upload counter.
Set both the upload and download counters to 0.


Initialize  upload and download BYTE counters to be equal to the current 
users file ratio.  If you select this option you are given the option to 
specify a number to multiply the number of files transferred to store in the 
bytes transferred fields.  For example, if a user has uploaded 3 files and 
downloaded 10 files and you specify a multiplier of 100, the user's byte 
counters will show 300 bytes uploaded and 1000 bytes downloaded.  The 
multiplier is simply for cosmetic purposes.  Also, you should be aware that 
if you select this option, your answers to the Adjust Upload / Download 
FILE/BYTE Counters questions will be ignored.

There are two other questions on this screen.  Your answer to these questions 
determine which counters will be set.

Adjust Upload / Download FILE Counters
Adjust Upload / Download BYTE Counters 


For example, if you select option number 3, and you set Adjust Upload / 
Download FILE Counters to Y, the following field will be set to 0 in each 
user's record:


Number Uploads
Number Downloads


Of course, if you answer Y to both questions, both of the following fields 
will be reset to 0 for all users:


Number Uploads
Number Downloads
Total Upload
Total Download
Registering Users In A Conference By Security Level


When you need to modify the conference registrations of a large number of 
users, you certainly would not want to do so manually. System Manager gives 
you the ability to modify a range of conference flags for users within a 
particular security range.

Selecting Conferences To Modify

The following fields allow you to control the users who will have their 
conference flags modified:


First number of conferences to be inserted in registrations
Last  number of conferences to be inserted in registrations

Enter the beginning conference number to be modified in the first field, and 
in the second field, enter the last conference number to be included in the 
list of conference registrations to be modified.  For example, if you want to 
modify the conference registrations for conferences 3 through 10, enter the 
following:


First number of conferences to be inserted in registrations :    3
Last  number of conferences to be inserted in registrations :   10


If you need to modify just one conference, enter the conference number as 
both the first and last conference to modify.

Setting Conference Flags

Once you have selected the conferences to modify, you must determine how you 
will be altering the access to the conference. The following five fields 
control what access you can give to a conference:


Adjust conferences user is normally allowed to join
Adjust conferences user can join with expired subscription
Adjust the user selected conferences for scanning
Adjust conferences where user becomes a sysop when joining
Reset user's last message read to zero in these conferences

The first four questions are simply the conference flags you may set (R, X, 
S, and C).  For additional information on conference flags, see Editing a 
User Record in the Users File Maintenance section of this chapter.  If you 
wish to reset the last message read pointer for each conference you modify, 
answer Y to the Reset user's last message read to zero in these conferences 
question.

Selecting User Records To Modify

The last thing you must determine is the range of users who will have their 
conference registration information changed.  Simply state the lowest 
security level you wish to modify and then the highest security level to 
modify.  Every user with a security level between the two levels you enter 
will have their conference information modified.

Making The Change

When you have finished entering the security levels, conference numbers and 
the conference flags you wish to modify, press PgDn to begin the process.

Before System Manager actually begins modifying the user file, it will 
attempt to make sure it has exclusive access to both the USERS and USERS.INF 
files.  If it cannot get exclusive access to these files, it will not be able 
to modify the records for each user.  Make sure all nodes are down before you 
attempt to make a global change such as inserting group conference 
registrations.

Examples

Let's assume you just created conference #3 on your system which displays 
community event information.  If you want to have that conference selected 
for reading by every user on your system, enter the following into each 
field:

As another example, suppose you want to create conference #53 to be a private 
conference for those with a security level of 90 or higher.  Since an R flag 
is required to be able to join a private conference, you might go about 
setting the flag manually in all user accounts with a security level of 90 or 
higher -- this would be quite an undertaking on a system with a large user 
base.  Instead, you can let System Manager do all of the hard work for you by 
entering the following information:

Removing Access To A Conference By Security Level

When you need to modify the conference registrations for a large number of 
users, you certainly do not want to do it manually. System Manager gives you 
the ability to modify a range of conference flags for users within a 
particular security range.

Selecting Conferences To Modify

The following fields allow you to control the users that will have their 
conference flags modified:


First number of conferences to be inserted in registrations
Last  number of conferences to be inserted in registrations


Enter the beginning conference number to be modified in the first field, and 
in the second field, enter the last conference number to be included in the 
list of conference registrations to be modified.  For example, if you wanted 
to modify the conference registrations for conferences 3 through 10, enter 
the following:


First number of conferences to be inserted in registrations :    3
Last  number of conferences to be inserted in registrations :   10


If you need to modify just one conference, enter the conference number as 
both the first and last conference to modify.

Deselecting Conference Flags

Once you have selected the conferences to modify, you must determine how you 
will be altering access to the conference. The following five fields control 
what access you can remove from a conference:


Adjust conferences user is normally allowed to join
Adjust conferences user can join with expired subscription
Adjust the user selected conferences for scanning
Adjust conferences where user becomes a sysop when joining
Reset user's last message read to zero in these conferences


The first four questions are simply the conference flags that you may set (R, 
X, S, and C).  For additional information on conference flags, see Editing a 
User Record in the Users File Maintenance section of this chapter.  If you 
wish to reset the last message read pointer for each conference you modify, 
answer Y to the Reset user's last message read to zero in these conferences 
question.

Selecting User Records To Modify

The last thing you must determine is the range of users who will have their 
conference registration information changed.  Simply state the lowest 
security level you wish to modify and then the highest security level to 
modify.  Every user with a security level between the two levels you enter 
will have their conference information modified.

Making The Change

When you have finished entering the security levels, conference numbers and 
the conference flags you wish to modify, press PgDn to begin the process.

Before System Manager actually begins modifying the user file, it will 
attempt to make sure it has exclusive access to both the USERS and USERS.INF 
files.  If it cannot get exclusive access to these files, it will not be able 
to modify the records for each user.  Make sure that all nodes are down 
before you attempt to make a global change such as inserting group conference 
registrations.

Examples

If you have 50 conferences on your system (conferences 0-49) and you want to 
make sure no users have conference SysOp status (the C flag), you can enter 
the following information:

Another example may be when you want to remove everyone with a security level 
less than 50 from conference #9 which is a private conference.  For this task 
you may want to remove all of their conference flags and reset their last 
message read to 0 as well.


Moving Access From One Conference To Another

From this menu option, you can move the access of users from one conference 
to another conference.  Not only can you move the conference flags from one 
conference to another, but you can also move the last message read to the new 
conference.

Specifying Conferences

In the REMOVE user(s) from which conference field, enter the conference 
number you wish to remove the conference access from. In the ADD to which 
conference field enter the conference number that you will be moving 
conference access to.

Moving Conference Information

The following lists which questions control the conference flags.  For a 
detailed description of conference flags see Editing a User Record in the 
Users File Maintenance section of this chapter.


	R	Adjust conferences user is allowed in (all times)
	X	Adjust conferences user is allowed in (expired)
	S	Adjust conference user-scan preference list

System Manager moves each conference flag field to the new conference exactly 
as set in the original conference.  It is recommended that you either leave 
all three of these questions set to Y or set to N.

The next question you are asked gives you the ability to modify the user 
record so it shows the Last Conference In field to reflect the new 
conference.  Of course, this will not be of much use unless the new 
conference is defined as an auto-rejoin conference.  If the new conference is 
defined as an auto-rejoin conference, affected users will be logged into this 
conference the next time they log in.

The last question asks if you wish to also move the last message number read 
from the old conference to the new conference.  If you answer Y in this 
field, the last message read number will be moved to the new conference, and 
the old conference will have the last message read set to 0.

Selecting Security Levels

As with other functions in System Manager, you determine what users will have 
their records modified by a range of security levels.  Simply enter the 
lowest and highest security level for the records you wish to modify.  Every 
record in the indicated security level range will be affected by the change.

Example

The following illustrates what to do if you want to move the conference 
information from conference 2 to conference 3 for users with a security level 
of 50.

First, while editing a user record for which you will be moving conference 
information, look at the conference form in System Manager.  You should see 
something similar to the following:

 Num   Conference    Flags   Last Msg
----- -------------  -----   --------
    0 Main Board    : RXS  :    51371
    1 OpSys         :      :        0
    2 Admin         : RXS  :   120022
    3 Chatter       : RX   :        0

Next, enter the following after selecting Move Users BETWEEN Conferences from 
the Users File Maintenance menu:

Finally, press PgDn to begin moving the conference information. System 
Manager is going to require exclusive access to USERS and USERS.INF, so make 
sure no other nodes are online before you press PgDn.  Otherwise, you will 
receive an error message and System Manager will continually try to access 
the file that until you press E to abort the process or the file is no longer 
in use.

Once the change has been made, you will see user records have been updated.  
Looking at the same record we reviewed before we made the change, you will 
now see:

 Num   Conference    Flags   Last Msg
----- -------------  -----   --------
    0 Main Board    : RXS  :    51371
    1 OpSys         :      :        0
    2 Admin         :      :        0
    3 Chatter       : RXS  :   120022

Notice that all of the conference information from conference 2 has been 
moved over to conference 3.

Adjusting Expiration Dates

When you need to upgrade the expiration date of several users, you can let 
System Manager's Change Expiration Date menu option do the work for you.  
Using this menu option you can update the expiration date of users on your 
system to a new date or add additional days to their expiration date.

Security Level Criteria

In order to modify the expiration date of users on your system, you need to 
specify a range of security levels that you wish to modify.  First however, 
you must select if you wish the security level range to be based on the 
normal or expired security level of each user.  The following are valid 
options for this field:

        E       Expired security level.  Base the range of security levels 
                that will be affected on the expired security level of each 
                user instead of the normal security level.

        N       Normal security level.  Base the range of security levels 
                that will be affected on the normal security level of each 
                user.


Specifying Security Range

Using the following field, you can specify the range of security levels 
(normal or expired) you wish to modify.


Adjust Expiration Date if level is Greater than or equal to
Adjust Expiration Date if level is Less than or equal to


For example, if you want to modify the range of security levels between 20 
and 30, enter a 20 in the first field and a 30 in the second field.

Setting New Expiration Date

You can choose to either set an actual date to change all records to or you 
may choose to simply add a certain amount of days to the expiration date of 
the user.  If you wish to make the new expiration date uniform throughout the 
range selected, specify the date at the following prompt:


New Expiration Date (01/01/80 is ignored)


If you leave the date in that field as 01-01-80, System Manager assumes you 
want to extend their current expiration date by the amount of days specified 
in the follwoing field:


Current Date in record plus XXXX days


Printing Changed Records

The final question on this screen asks if you wish to print a report of users 
who have their user records changed.  If you answer Y to this question, a 
report will be printed to the printer you have defined in System Manager.  
This report will contain:


User name
Security level
Old expiration date
New expiration date


Making The Change

When you have filled in all of the fields, press PgDn to begin changing the 
records.  If System Manager can gain exclusive access to the users file, it 
will begin modifying the records you have specified.  If System Manager 
cannot guarantee it has exclusive access, it will print a message that states 
LOCK FAILED.  In order to gain exclusive access to the users file, make sure 
you do not have any nodes up and running or ready to take calls.

Example

To help illustrate the advantage of being able to globally change expiration 
dates, let's use the following example:

You accept subscriptions to your system where your users will pay money for 
one year of access.

Your subscribers occupy security levels 60-80.

Keeping all of this in mind, let's assume you had system troubles that caused 
you to be down for two days in a row.  To help relations with what may be 
several angry subscribers, you decide to extend all subscription by an 
additional week (7 days).  Rather than manually modify each record you can 
use System Manager's Change Expiration Date menu option.  Fill in the fields 
on the screen as follows:


Security Level Range
--------------------
Base Security Level Criteria on NORMAL or EXPIRED Level (N/E) : N
Adjust Expiration Date if level is Greater than or equal to   : 60
Adjust Expiration Date if level is Less than or equal to      : 80


Change Expiration Date To:
--------------------------
New Expiration Date (01/01/80 is ignored) : 01-01-80
Current Date in record plus XXXX days     :    7

Print Changed User Records on the Printer : N


Standardizing Phone Formats

Selecting this menu option will standardize the phone fields for every user 
on your system.  Essentially, this option merely strips all non-numerical 
information from the phone field and attempts to fit the phone number into 
the following format:


 999 999-9999


If the phone number is shorter than 10 digits, 1t will start building the 
phone number from the right.  Therefore, if one of the phone numbers in the 
user record was 323-835, System Manager will convert this phone number to 
32-3835.  Once all of your phone numbers are standardized, you can reliably 
sort the users file by the contents of this field.

Undo Previous Change

Selecting this menu option will enable you to undo any global changes you 
have made to the users file while in System Manager. The following lists all 
of the global changes you can make in System Manager:

Sort Users File
Pack Users File
Pack Users File while Online
Adjust Security Level by Ranges
Adjust Expired Security Level by Ranges
Adjust Up/Dn File Ratio
Adjust Up/Dn Byte Ratio
Change Security to Expired Level
Initialize Upld/Dnld Counters
Insert Group Conference
Remove Group Conference
Adjust Expiration Dates
Standardize Phone Formats

When you select the undo option, you will be asked to confirm that you really 
wish to undo your most recent global change.  If you select to undo your 
changes, System Manger will restore the last backup of the USERS and 
USERS.INF file and then re-index your users file to make sure the index files 
are current.

User Info File Maintenance

User Info File Maintenance refers to maintaining your USERS.INF file.  
Because the USERS.INF file is so flexible there are a lot of functions you 
can use, although not nearly so many as with the USERS file alone.  
Everything you will need to do with the USERS.INF file will be controlled 
from the menu that will appear after you select User Info File Maintenance 
from the System Manager Main Menu.

Change Conference Allocations

The size of the USERS.INF file is dynamic.  This means it can grow or shrink 
based on the components installed inside of the file.  For example, PCBoard 
stores the last message read pointers in this file.  As you would expect, the 
more conferences that you have, the bigger the file will be because you have 
more last message read pointers to store.

To make sure your USERS.INF file is properly configured for the number of 
conferences you have installed on your system, select this menu option.  If 
you see an error message that says Need to update User Info File Conference 
Allocations, you need to select this menu option to properly insure that your 
USERS.INF file is properly sized.  If you receive this previously mentioned 
error message, you will need to load System Manager from the DOS prompt 
because you will not be able to access it from the call-waiting screen.  
Simply change to your PCBoard subdirectory and execute PCBSM.EXE.

When you select this menu option you will see a status report about your 
USERS.INF file.  Each section is detailed in the following sections.


Total Conference Areas

This lists the total number of conferences you have defined for your system.  
PCBoard determines this number by reading the PCBOARD.DAT that System Manager 
reads when it loaded and looking at what is set for the Number of Highest 
Conference Desired in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Messages.  System 
Manager then adds one to this number to account for the Main Board.

For this reason, it becomes important that if you increase the maximum number 
of conferences desired, you should also update every PCBOARD.DAT you use on 
your system.  Otherwise, you can find yourself repeatedly updating conference 
allocations because you have a different amount of conferences available 
depending on which PCBOARD.DAT is read.

Number of EXTENDED Conferences

This field will report how many extended conferences you have (or 0 for 
none).  Any conferences above the first 40 are considered to be extended 
conferences.  This is simply a name reference and does not signify a 
difference between conferences. The name reference is used because earlier 
versions of PCBoard supported 40 conferences which has long since been 
surpassed.

Total static user allocation

This field will tell you how many static bytes will be allocated for each 
record.  Static allocations are not dependent on the number of conferences.

Total dynamic allocations

Dynamic allocations are dependent on the number of conferences you have 
allocated on your system.  As the number of conferences on your system 
increases, so will the dynamic allocations on your system.

Updating USERS.INF Conference Allocations

After the report of allocations and total conferences on your system, you 
will see one of the following messages:

None of the above allocations require upgrading at this time...

WARNING:  One or more of the above allocations requires updating

If you see the former message, you do not have to worry about updating your 
conference allocations.  However, if you see the latter message, you must 
update your conference allocations or you will not be able to load PCBoard.

List Installed PSA/TPA Areas

This menu function will list all of the third party allocation (TPA) and 
PCBoard support allocation (PSA) areas that are currently installed.  TPAs 
are areas in your USERS.INF file reserved for specific third party 
applications.  PSAs are specific features you can add such as full address 
support, alias support, etc.

When you choose this menu option, you will see a list of all TPA and PSA 
areas that are installed on your system.

If you have not installed any TPAs or PSAs, you will be notified that you do 
not have any installed.  If you do have one or more installed, System Manager 
will display information about each one.

The first piece of information will display if the allocation is a PSA or a 
TPA followed by the name of the allocation.  Even though you may not need to 
know any additional information, you will also be shown the version number 
and  the total static/dynamic space allocated for each user.  For TPAs, 
System Manager will also show you the Key information which is used by each 
third party program.

Add PCBoard Supported Allocations

From this menu option, you can install a PCBoard Supported Allocations (PSA).  
These give you the ability add functionality to your system such as alias or 
full-address support.  For more information on adding a PSA please see the 
Adding a PSA section in this chapter.

Remove PSA From User Info File

Simply select the PSA you wish to remove from your system. Before System 
Manager removes the PSA it will ask to confirm that you really wish to delete 
it.  For additional information, please see the Removing A PSA section in 
this chapter.

Add/Update Third Party Application

A TPA gives a third party application the ability to have PCBoard reserve 
space in the USERS.INF file for its use.  Most applications will use this 
reserved area or allocation to store information about each user.  Using this 
method, an application does not have to create a separate data file to store 
redundant user information, nor does it have to worry about maintaining this 
file of active user data.  The TPA is actually part of the USERS.INF file, so 
when a user is deleted from your system, all TPA information for that user is 
deleted too.

Normally, you will only install a TPA if the application you are installing 
explicitly tells you to setup a TPA in System Manager.

When you choose to add a TPA, you will be asked to enter the TPA name.  Enter 
the name in this field as specified by the author of the application.  If you 
do not, the application may error upon loading because the wrong name was 
entered in this field.

If you enter the name of a TPA which already exists, the existing information 
will be displayed and you can edit the fields as your needs dictate.

Once you have entered a new application name, you will be asked to specify 
the version number, static allocation, dynamic allocation, and a keyword.  
The author of the application should provide the values you should enter for 
everything except keyword. 

Version:  Just as most programs have a version number, a TPA can have a 
version number as well.  The application which uses this TPA may use this 
version number to verify it is indeed reading proper data.  

Static Size:  There are two size types in a TPA.  Static size never changes 
-- it is a fixed size.  You need to enter the value the author of the 
application specifies.  If you enter a value which is too high or too low, 
chances are the application will error upon loading or behave unpredictably.

Dynamic Size:  Enter the value the author of the application specifies for 
this field.  This determines how many bytes will be reserved for each 
conference.  Consequently, the more conferences you have defined in your 
system, the more space this will end up taking on your hard drive.

Keyword:  In this field, enter the door name that will use this TPA.  This 
information can be obtained from the filename field in your DOORS.LST file.  
If you do not specify a valid door name, the information in the TPA will not 
be available to the application requesting the information.

Remove TPA From User Info File

To remove a TPA, you must know the name.  If you do not know the name, you 
can use the List Installed PSA/TPA Areas menu option for a list of installed 
allocations.  When you enter the name of the TPA that you wish to remove, 
System Manager will check to see if it exists.  If it does, you will be asked 
to confirm that you wish to remove the TPA.  If you choose to remove it, all 
data stored in the TPA will be lost as it is removed from the USERS.INF file.

Create User Info File

Normally you will not need to create your USERS.INF file because PCBoard will 
take care of that for you.  However, if you lose the file or if it becomes 
corrupt beyond repair, you may elect to recreate the file.

If System Manager detects a USERS.INF file when you attempt to re-create it, 
you will be warned that it already exists and will be asked to confirm that 
you want to recreate the file. Recreating the file will cause all TPA 
information to be lost as well as the loss of some conference information for 
all conferences numbered 40 and above.

Analyzing Your System Configuration

This menu option will load PCBDiag which you can use to help analyze your 
system configuration.  When you select this menu item, you will be preseneted 
with a list of items that you can analyze.  To do a full analysis, make sure 
you enter a Y in all of the fields.

Once you determine what you want to analyze, press PgDn to begin. You will be 
asked where the report should be printed.  In the field, you can enter any 
printer port or filename.  Specifying a printer port such as LPT1 will send 
the report to the printer attached to LPT1 while entering a filename will 
print the report to the file you specify.

When you are working with the technical support staff to resolve a problem 
with your system, you may be asked to print or output your analysis to a 
file.  In this situation you should always print the report to a file and 
upload the file to Salt Air.  The technician assisting you will review the 
file and continue working with you on the problem.

Defining Printer Port

There are several places in System  Manager that allow you to print out 
reports or results of a particular action.  System Manager will use the 
printer that you define using this menu option.

The first thing you will notice about the printer definition is that you can 
enter more than a simple port number.  You can enter any filename or device.  
If your printer is on LPT1, enter LPT1 in this field.  If, instead, you wish 
to send all printer output to a text file, you can do so by specifying a 
filename to send the output to.

The following are sample printer definitions:


LPT1
LPT2
C:\PCB\PRINTER.OUT
F:\PRN\PCBOARD.PRN
COM1
COM2


Defining Your Editors

When you are configuring your system in PCBSetup, there are several places 
where you need to load an editor to edit a batch file or a display screen.  
This menu option allows you to specify the editors you want to have available 
while in PCBSetup.  There are two editors you may specify -- text and 
graphics.

Text Editor	

Throughout PCBSetup you will notice that you can press F2 in several places 
to edit a particular file.  If the file you are editing is a display file or 
a batch file, PCBSetup will use the editor you define in this field to edit 
the file.

By default, the editor selected here will be PCBEdit, which is a 
text/graphics editor which ships with PCBoard.  If you have a favorite text 
editor, you may specify that program name instead. However, if you opt to 
change the editor, you will want to pick a small ASCII text editor rather 
than a word processing type program because of the memory constraints 
involved, and because the file must be saved in DOS text format.

When PCBSetup calls your editor, it will run the program and pass the 
filename to edit as the first and only parameter. Therefore, the editor you 
install must be capable of accepting the filename to edit on the command 
line.

Graphics Editor

When a display file is highlighted in PCBSetup, you can use F2 to edit the 
normal display file, or F3 to edit the graphics specific version of the same 
file.  

When you press F3, System Manager will use the editor you have defined as 
your graphics editor to edit the graphics specific version of the display 
file.  This is most useful when you need to create a plain ASCII file for 
your non-graphic callers but then choose to make a graphics specific file 
with animation or similar effects.

You will want to use a graphics editor that will support either ANSI or 
PCBoard @X codes.  Included with your PCBoard package you will find 
PCBEDIT.EXE.  PCBEdit will create ASCII text files and it has the ability to 
create colorized display screens using PCBoard @X color codes.

The graphics editor is called in the same manner as the text editor.  The 
filename to edit will be passed on the command line so you need to use a 
graphics editor program that is capable of accepting the filename on the 
command line.

Customize Colors

Everyone has their own likes and dislikes -- color is no exception.  Using 
this menu option you can customize the colors that are used for the PCBoard 
utilities (PCBSetup, System Manager, etc.)

Using Predefined Defaults

System  Manager provides you with several default color schemes you can use 
by simply selecting the menu options on your screen. The first color set is 
the default color set when you first receive PCBoard.  If you do not like any 
of the default color sets you may customize the colors manually using the 
Customize Colors menu option.

Customizing Your Own Colors

Upon selecting the Customize Colors menu option you will see the following 
screen (once you have read the instructions and pressed R):


This screen contains several objects.  You will notice part of a help window, 
a menu listing, questions, and many other fields and borders.  The 
instructions for colorizing this screen to your own tastes are very simple:

Move the cursor (using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys) until the 
cursor is on top of the item or object you wish to modify, and press ENTER.

From the color box that pops up, use the cursor keys to select the color you 
wish to use for the currently selected item.  It is important to remember 
that each color selection contains a background and a foreground color.  The 
foreground attribute for each color is represented by an X; this is the color 
the text will be for the currently selected item.  The background attribute 
is the color the text will be written on.

Repeat steps one and two as many times as you need until you have finished 
customizing your colors.  When you are done, press ESC.  You will be returned 
to the Color Customization menu.  If you press ESC again to return to the 
Main Menu you will be asked if you wish to save your color set.

PCBoard Supported Allocations

You can optionally install what are called PSAs (PCBoard Supported 
Allocations).  These are features that are added into your users file.  

What Are Supported Allocations

A supported allocation is a module you can add to your users file which both 
PCBoard and System Manager are able to understand and manipulate.  These 
allocations are quite similar to TPAs you can install for doors.  The 
difference is that PSAs are officially recognized by PCBoard and are used to 
add new features to your system.  The following PSAs are available:

Alias Support - Enables a user to use an alias in those conferences which 
have been designated to allow aliases.

Full Address Support - Gives you the ability to store street, city, state, 
zip code, and country information for each user on your system.

Password-Changing Support - Gives you the ability to force your users to 
change their passwords over a pre-determined amount of time.

Verification Support - This PSA will store the response to the question asked 
when a new account is created on your system. You can use this response to 
help verify the validity of the caller.

Caller Statistics - Provides additional statistics about each user on your 
system.  Records statistics such as security violations, speed of 
connections, etc.

Caller Notes - Provides you five additional comment lines which you can store 
information about each user.  These lines may be useful for jotting down 
general notes.

Adding An Allocation

First of all, you need to make sure all nodes on your system are down -- you 
cannot add a PSA while nodes are online.

To add a PSA to your system, select Add PCBoard Supported Allocations from 
the User Info File Maintenance menu in System Manager.  Choose the PSA you 
wish to add to your system from the menu presented to you.  Next, you will be 
shown information about the PSA you are about to install and are asked to 
confirm you wish to continue with the installation.

If you received an error which said there was a sharing violation with 
USERS.INF, this indicates all of your nodes are not down or something is 
accessing your USERS.INF file.  System manager needs to have exclusive access 
to that file before it can add a PSA.

When you add a PSA, the size of your USERS.INF file will increase in size.  
The following lists shows how many bytes the file will increase for each 
users on your system:


Alias - 25 bytes
Full Address - 160 bytes
Password Changing - 42 bytes
Verification - 25 bytes
Caller Statistics - 30 bytes
Caller Notes - 300 bytes

If you have 2000 users in your system, your USERS.INF will grow by 60,000 
bytes if you add the Caller Statistics PSA.

Using An Allocation

The following section gives specific details as far as what you can expect 
after you install each PSA in your system.  You will know what changes will 
be made to your system operation and how to access the various information 
that each PSA provides.

Alias

Alias support is added on a conference by conference basis. After you have 
installed the Alias PSA in System Manager as outlined in the previous 
section, you need to configure which conferences will enable alias support.

When you are editing conference information, you can press PgDn to access 
conference switches.  You will see an option labeled Allow Aliases to be 
used.  If you want aliases to be used in the conference you are editing, 
change this option to Y.

In order for a user to define the alias they wish to use, the W user command 
must be used.  Alias names can only be changed or created in conferences that 
have been defined to allow Aliases. The name entered must be unique -- it 
cannot duplicate any user or alias name currently in use on the system.  In 
PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control there is an option which 
reads Allow Alias Change After Chosen.  When this option is set to N, a user 
must request any alias changes be done by you. Otherwise, the alias name can 
be changed at will by using the W user command.

At any time, you can edit or view the alias for any given user through System 
Manager by editing the user's record.  Press F2 until you get to the Alias 
support screen.  On this screen, you will see the alias name the user has 
chosen.  If the field is blank, the user has not defined an alias.

If you are editing the user record and you press F2 several times but do not 
see the Alias support screen, chances are you have not installed the Alias 
PSA.  To make sure you have installed the PSA, check the list of installed 
TPA Areas in System Manager | User Info File Maintenance | List Installed TPA 
Areas.  When you select this option, you should see a TPA called PCBALIAS. If 
you do not, you have not installed the alias PSA yet.

Aliases are only active when a user joins a conference that has been defined 
to allow aliases.  In the rest of the conferences, the user's real name is 
always used.  Of course with users switching between their real name and 
alias name upon joining conferences, hiding the name change becomes important 
to protect the identity change.

To help protect the alias, there is an option in PCBSetup | Node 
Configuration which asks Show ALIAS Names in WHO Display.  If you answer Y to 
this question, PCBoard will modify the node display to show that a user is 
logging in under that node where the name change is occurring.  This will 
remain  for approximately one minute before it changes the actual name in the 
node display.  On the other hand, if you answer N to this question, real 
names will always be displayed even when a conference is joined where aliases 
are allowed.

Two other changes are made in the way PCBoard operates in order to protect 
the alias identity.

While inside a conference where aliases are allowed, the security level 
requirement for the USERS command is changed to become equal to that which is 
required to use the 7 SysOp function.  This enables you to still use the 
USERS command while making it impossible for normal callers to access the 
command. If users could access the command, they may be able to simply 
compare logon dates/times to figure out the real name of a particular user.

The City/State information normally shown by the WHO user command or the 11 
SysOp command will not be shown when a user is using an alias.  If that 
information were available to all callers, it would make it easier for other 
users to figure out the true identities of those using aliases.

When a user has defined an alias either the real name or alias of the user 
can be used to login to the system.  If the user chooses to login using the 
alias and the conference joined at login is not an alias conference, PCBoard 
will properly use their real name instead of their alias.

Address

If you want to keep track of addresses for each of your users, install the 
Address PSA.  This PSA, will store lines for the street address, city, state, 
zip code and country.

If you have the Address PSA installed, new users will be asked to provide 
address information when the registration questions for createing a new 
account on the system are asked.  If you have existing users on your system 
who have not entered their address information, you can tell your users to 
use the W user command to update their address information, or you can use a 
PPE that is designed to assure that every user has a valid address.  On Salt 
Air (the support BBS for Clark Development) you will find a PPE which will do 
this under the filename GET-ADRS.ZIP.

If you clear out any of the PCBTEXT records between 699 and 704 with 
MKPCBTXT, those questions will not be asked.  This would be useful if you 
want to eliminate a question such as Country from being asked.

The address information can be edited via the W user command or by loading 
System Manager and editing the user record (Pressing F2 to switch between 
views).  When you use the 7 SysOp Command to edit a user record, you can view 
the address information but you cannot change it.

Password Changing

When you install the Password Changing PSA, you add the capability to force 
your callers to change their password over the period of time that you 
specify.

PCBoard will keep track of the last date the password for each user was last 
changed, the number of times they have changed it, and the last three 
passwords used.  By accessing the last three passwords used, the user will be 
prevented from toggling between two or three passwords.  In addition, the 
passwords chosen must contain the minimum number of characters as defined in 
PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Limits and must also not contain either 
the first or last name of the user.

If you load System Manager and access a user's record, you can look at the 
password information by pressing F2 until you get to the Password Form 
screen.  On this screen you will see information such as the last three 
passwords used, the last date the password was changed, etc.  The Expiration 
Date is used to determine when this particular user needs to change their 
password.  When the password is expired, the user cannot login to the system 
until a new valid password is entered.  The following restrictions are in 
place for the new password:

The new password must meet the minimum length requirements specified in 
PCBSetup |  Configuration Options | Limits.

Users may not use their name as their password.  For example, a user named 
James Brown could not use either James or Brown as his password.

Of course, if you want to expire a particular user's password, edit their 
user record so the password expiration date is equal to or earlier than 
today's date.

You can control how often a user needs to change their password by changing 
the Number Days Before FORCED Password Change in PCBSetup | Configuration 
Options | Limits.  If you want to temporarily disable the Password Changing 
PSA but plan on enabling it at a later date, enter a value of 0 in this field 
to disable the Password Changing support.

You can warn callers of the upcoming need to change their password so they 
are not caught totally off-guard by the request to change their password.  In 
PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Limits the following field can be changed:

Number Days to Warn Prior to FORCED Change

Set this value to the number of days you want to warn the caller before their 
password will expire.  When users log into the system during the warning 
period, record number 711 in your PCBTEXT file will be displayed to let them 
know their password is about to expire.

In recent years, automated calling to pick up messages or files has become 
very popular.  Since PCBoard normally displays a simple one-line message to 
notify the user their password is about to expire, some of your users may 
miss the warning.  If this becomes a problem on your system, you may want to 
modify this PCBTEXT record so that it displays a file (which can be multiple 
lines), or even a PPE which can leave a personal message so they could pick 
up the notification in their automated mail or file runs.

Whatever warning method you ultimately choose, it should be as obvious as 
possible.  Otherwise, your callers who use login scripts, automated calling 
programs, and such may wonder why they cannot log into the system properly.  
For this very reason, it might be advantageous to give a two to three week 
password expiration warning.

Verification

Verification support adds one 25 character field you can use to store 
information to help determine the validity of a particular caller.  If you 
have the verification PSA enabled, new users will be required to answer the 
registration question.  By default, this question will ask for the maiden 
name of the caller's mother.  However, you can change this to ask any 
question you would like by using MKPCBTXT to edit record #706 in PCBTEXT.

Once the new user enters the information, it cannot be modified. In fact, 
users cannot even view the information.  The only one who can change or view 
the verification field is you.

There are a lot of things you could use this verification field for.  The 
following is just a short list:

Birth date.  You could modify record #706 in PCBTEXT so the user is asked for 
their birth date.  When you view a user record with the 7 SysOp command you 
would be able to quickly and easily reference what a particular user entered 
for their birth date.

Password change request.  When a user fails to enter the right password for 
login, you have the capability of enabling the user to leave a comment.  If 
you have that option enabled in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System 
Control,  you may want to use a PPE that could ask the user to enter their 
verification information.  If they enter the right information you could use 
that same PPE to change their password.

System security.  If the information you distribute on your system requires 
you to be conscious about system security, you can use the verification field 
and a PPE to ask each user to enter the data in the verification field at 
each login.  In essence, this will give the user a second password and would 
greatly diminish the capability of hacking a user account by the brute force 
method.

Caller Statistics

If you enjoy gathering statistics about your callers, you may want to enable 
the Statistics PSA.  PCBoard will keep track of how many times a user has 
connected to the system, what speed they connected at, and numerous other 
pieces of information. The following is a sample of the Statistics View 
available when you are editing a user record in System Manager:

To view this information for a particular user, load System Manager, select 
Users File Maintenance, and Edit Users File. Next, press F2 until you see the 
Statistics Form screen.

The following list describes each of the statistics that are tracked:

First Date On:  This date will be equal to the date the user first logged 
into your system or the date you added the Caller Statistics PSA if the 
account already existed.

Last Date On:  The last date the user logged into your system. You can also 
see this date on the Long Form screen.

Num Times On:  The total number of times this particular caller has accessed 
your system.  This information is also available on the Long Form screen.


# Times Paged Sysop:  This field will record the total number of times this 
user has paged the SysOp to chat.  It does not matter if the page was 
answered or not -- all attempts are recorded.

# Times Group Chat:  If a user uses group chat with others on the system, the 
total number of chat sessions the user has participated in will be recorded 
in this field.  SysOp chats are not included in this total.

# Comments to Sysop:  This field records the total number of comments the 
user has left to the SysOp using the C user command.  If the user begins a 
comment but aborts the message, it does not count as a comment to the sysop.

# Messages Left:  This field will store the total number of messages the user 
has entered.  You should be aware that while PCBoard may update this 
statistic, off-line mail reading doors may not.

# Messages Read:  Displays the total number of messages the user has read on 
your system.  While PCBoard will update this field, some off-line mail door 
programs may not.



# Security Violations:  You can easily see who may be trying to access 
restricted functions on your system, by watching this field.  It will total 
up the number of times a user has attempted to access a command which is not 
available to the user's security level.

# Un-Reg Conf Attempts:  Records the total number of attempts to join a 
conference the user is not registered to join.

# Password Failures:  Displays the number of times the wrong password was 
used at login.  If you keep tabs on this statistic, you may be able to catch 
someone who is trying to hack into a given account.

# Dnld Limit Reached:  Records the total number of times the user has 
exceeded the defined download limits.  Any file that will exceed the user's 
ratio or daily download limit is recorded as a violation.

# Dnld File Not Found:  If the user attempts to download a file, but the 
filename could not be found on disk, it will be recorded in this field.  

# Upld Verify Failed:  After uploading a file, PCBoard will test the file via 
PCBTEST.BAT unless you have disabled upload testing.  If the uploaded file 
fails the integrity tests, it will be recorded in this field.



# Times On at 300:  Displays the total number of times the user connected at 
300 bps.

# Times On at 1200:  Displays the total number of times the user connected at 
1200 bps.

# Times On at 2400:  Displays the total number of times the user connected at 
2400 bps.

# Times On at 9600:  Displays the total number of times the user connected at 
4800, 7200 or 9600 bps.  All three speeds are shown in this field, because 
they are all only possible with 9600 bps modems.

# Times On at 14400+:  Displays the total number of times the user connected 
at 12000 bps or higher.  The reason 12000 bps is included in this statistic 
is because it is a fall-back speed for 14400 connections.


All of these statistics are stored in your USERS.INF file. Therefore, if you 
lose your USERS.INF or it becomes corrupted for some reason, you risk the 
chance of losing your statistics. In addition, you can lose your statistics 
if you re-create your USERS.INF file via System Manager | User Info File 
Maintenance | Create User Info File.

Caller Notes

You may find the 30 characters you are allocated in Comment 2 for each user 
may not provide enough space to enter comments about each user.  If you need 
more room, you can install the Caller Notes PSA.  If you do, you will find 
that you have 5 additional 60 characters lines that you can enter comments 
about each user.

As you can see there is plenty of room to leave comments about any user on 
your system.  The notes section provides a good place where you can enter 
things you want to remember about a particular user.  Since the user cannot 
edit or even view these notes, you can be as frank as you wish.

Viewing PSA Information

There are two methods of viewing information on the various PSAs you have 
installed. From within System Manager each PSA will have a separate screen.  
These screens can only be viewed while you are editing a user record.  Press 
F2 to switch between the various screen views.  Normally, the Short Form, 
Long Form, and Conference screens are the only screens available.  However, 
when you install a PSA, additional screens will become available when you 
press F2. 

When you are viewing PSA information in System Manager, you can also edit the 
PSA information for each user.

While inside PCBoard, you can also view selected PSA Information with the 7 
SysOp command.  All PSA information with the exception of the Password 
Changing, and Caller Statistics can be viewed with the 7 command.


This is the information that will be displayed via the 7 SysOp command if you 
have all of the PSAs installed and there is information in each PSA.  Notice, 
that only the Alias, Address, Notes, and Verification information is 
displayed.  To edit this information or to view the rest of the PSA 
information, use System Manager.

Removing An Installed PSA

To remove a PSA you have installed, you will need to select System Manager | 
User Info File Maintenance | Remove PSA From User Info File simply select the 
PSA you wish to remove.  If the PSA does exist, you will be asked to confirm 
that you really wish to delete the PSA.  If you the PSA was not installed, 
you will receive an error message notifying you that you attempted to remove 
a PSA which is not installed.

Command Line Parameters

Most of the functionality of System Manager can be accessed directly by using 
command line parameters when you load PCBSM.EXE.

Since you can access most common functions of System Manager from the command 
line, you can setup your event or other batch files to perform these tasks 
without actually having to move around in the menu structure or even be 
present to fill in all of the options.

To specify a command line parameter, simply add it after PCBSM.EXE when you 
load it, as shown in this example:


PCBSM.EXE /ADJUST;byteratio


In this example, the /ADJUST is the command line parameter and byteratio is a 
sub-parameter used to specify more information or to further clarify the 
command line parameter.  As shown in the previous example, you separate 
sub-parameters with semi-colons (;).  You will learn more about /ADJUST in 
the detailed explanations of the command line parameters that follow.

/ADJUST

This command line parameter gives you the ability to adjust the security 
level of users based on their upload and download activities.  You can adjust 
based on their file or byte ratio, or by the number of file transfers the 
user has completed.  To control which method you will use to adjust their 
security levels, use the following sub-parameters.

fileratio

This sub-command will adjust the security levels of users by using the file 
ratio table you have created in System Manager | Users File Maintenance | 
Adjust Security Levels | Create Up/Dn File Ratio Table.

Using this sub-parameter will perform the same action available via System 
Manager | Users File Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Up/Dn 
File Ratio.

byteratio

This sub-command will adjust the security levels of users by using the byte 
ratio table you have created in System Manager | Users File Maintenance | 
Adjust Security Levels | Create Up/Dn Byte Ratio Table.

Using this sub-parameter will perform the same action available via System 
Manager | Users File Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Up/Dn 
Byte Ratio.

uploads

If you use this sub-parameter, the security levels of the users on your 
system will be adjusted based on the table you have setup in System Manager | 
Users File Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Upload Table

Using this sub-parameter is identical to System Manager | Users File 
Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Number of Uploads

downloads

If you use this sub-parameter, the security levels of the users on your 
system will be adjusted based on the table you have setup in System Manager | 
Users File Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Download Table

Using this sub-parameter is identical to System Manager | Users File 
Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Adjust by Number of Downloads 

print

Use this to specify you wish to print any user that have their security level 
changed.  The output will go to the printer defined in System Manager.  This 
is the only sub-parameter in this section  that you can combine with others.  
For example, the following is perfectly valid:


PCBSM /ADJUST;byteratio;print


However, this example is not:


PCBSM /ADJUST;byteratio;fileratio



        Example

        PCBSM /ADJUST;byteratio;print

        This command line would load System  Manager and adjust security 
        levels based on the byte ratio of each user.  All users who have 
        their security levels changed will be printed to your defined 
        printer.



/SECURITY

This command line parameter will allow you to assign a new security level to 
an existing range of security levels on your system.  For example, if you 
wished to change the security level of everyone between 20 and 30 to simply 
have security level of 25, use this parameter.

lowsec:[security level]

Specifies the lowest security level of the range you wish to adjust.  You 
need to also use the highsec sub-parameter to specify the highest number in 
the range of security levels.  Any user record that has a security level 
which is either equal to or between the lowsec and highsec sub-parameters 
will have its security level adjusted.  Replace [security level] with the 
actual security level between 0 and 255 (e.g., 82).

highsec:[security level]

Specifies the lowest security level of the range you wish to adjust.  You 
need to also use the lowsec sub-parameter to specify the lowest number in the 
range of security levels.  Any user record that has a security level which is 
either equal to or between the lowsec and highsec sub-parameters will have 
its security level adjusted.  Replace [security level] with the actual 
security level between 0 and 255 (e.g., 105).

newsec:[security level]

This sub-parameter defines what the new security level will be for the 
security levels that are specified with the lowsec and highsec 
sub-parameters.  Replace [security level] with the actual security level 
between 0 and 255 (e.g., 35).


        Example
        
        PCBSM /SECURITY;lowsec:32;highsec:42;newsec:58

        Would change the security level of any user with a security level 
        between 32 and 42 and make their new security level 58.



/EXPSECURITY

This parameter performs the same function as the /SECURITY parameter, but the 
expired security level is used instead of the normal security level.  Using 
this parameter will prove very useful if you have a bunch of users that have 
expired security levels between 30 and 40 but you realize you can save time 
by consolidating them into one single expired level.

lowsec:[security level]

Specifies the lowest expired security level of the range you wish to adjust.  
You need to also use the highsec sub-parameter to specify the highest number 
in the range of expired security levels.  Any user record with an expired 
security level that is either equal to or between the lowsec and highsec 
sub-parameters will have its security level adjusted.  Replace [security 
level] with an expired security level between 0 and 255  (e.g., 82).

highsec:[security level]

Specifies the lowest security level of the range you wish to adjust.  You 
need to also use the lowsec sub-parameter to specify the lowest number in the 
range of expired security levels.  Any user record with an expired security 
level that is either equal to or between the lowsec and highsec 
sub-parameters will have its expired security level adjusted.  Replace 
[security level] with a valid expired security level between 0 and 255 (e.g., 
105).

newsec:[security level]

This sub-parameters defines what the new security level will be for the 
security levels specified with the lowsec and highsec sub-parameters.  
Replace [security level] with the actual security level between 0 and 255 
(e.g., 35).


        Example
        
        PCBSM /EXPSECURITY;lowsec:50;highsec:70;newsec:45

        Will modify the user records of those who have an expired security 
        level between 50 and 70.  Their old expired security level will 
        become 45 as specified by the newsec parameter.





/COPYEXPIRED

This command line parameter will change the normal security level of users 
whose subscription has expired to that of their expired security level.  This 
type of change is most helpful when you do not plan on renewing the 
subscription for a particular user.  Usually, the user's normal security 
level will remain unchanged so that when they renew their subscription they 
will retain their old access.  Using this parameter is the same as selecting 
System Manager | Users File Maintenance | Adjust Security Levels | Change 
Security to Expired Level.

print

This is the only sub-parameter you may specify.  If you use it, any users who 
have their security levels changed will be printed to the printer defined in 
System Manager.


        Example

        PCBSM.EXE /COPYEXPIRED;print
        
        This example will change the security level of any user whose 
        subscription has expired.  The user's normal security level will be 
        set to equal their expired security level.  In addition, because the 
        print sub-command was specified, any user who has their record 
        changed will be printed to the defined printer.



/EXPIRE

This command line parameter will allow you to change the expiration date of a 
group of users.  The group of users who have their expiration date changed is 
based on either a range of normal or expired security levels.

normalsec

If you use this sub-parameter, the security levels you specify using the 
lowsec and highsec sub-parameters will be based on the normal security level 
of the user.  You must select either this or the expiredsec sub-parameter to 
tell System Manager whether it should use the regular or expired security 
level.

expiredsec

If you use this sub-parameter, the security levels you specify using the 
lowsec and highsec sub-parameters will be based on the expired security level 
of the user.  You must select either this or the normalsec sub-parameter to 
tell System Manager whether it should use the regular or expired security 
level.

lowsec:[security level]

This sub-parameter will specify the lowest security level for which to adjust 
the expiration date.  Remember that the security level you specify will be 
based on the normal or expired security level, depending on whether you used 
the normalsec or expiredsec sub-parameter.  Replace [security level] with the 
actual security level (e.g., 38).  This sub-parameter is required.

highsec:[security level]

This sub-parameter will specify the highest security level for which to 
adjust the expiration date.  Remember that the security level you specified 
will be based on the normal or expired security level, depending on whether 
you used the normalsec or expiredsec sub-parameter.  Replace [security level] 
with the actual security level (e.g., 75).  This sub-parameter is required.

date:[date]

You can modify the expiration dates for users specified via the lowsec and 
highsec parameters, either by a entering a specific date or by increasing the 
current expiration date by a set amount of days.  If you use this parameter, 
the user's expiration date will be set to the calendar date entered here. The 
date you specify must be in the MMDDYY format where MM is the month, DD is 
the day, and YY is the year.  You are required to use either this 
sub-parameter or the days parameter but you may not specify both.

days:[number of days]

You can modify the expiration dates for users specified via the lowsec and 
highsec parameters, either by a entering a specific date or by increasing the 
current expiration date by a set amount of days.  If you use this parameter, 
the user's current expiration date will be increased by the number of days 
you specify.  You are required to use either this sub-parameter or the date 
parameter but you may not specify both.

print

This parameter will print information about users whose expiration dates have 
been  modified.  This report will be printed to the location you specified in 
System Manager | Define Printer Port.


        Example
        
        PCBSM /EXPIRE:normalsec;lowsec:30;highsec:40;days:30

        This example will add 30 days to the subscription of every user who 
        has a normal security level between 30 and 40.


/GROUP

This command line parameter will enable you to set or remove the three most 
commonly used conference flags for a group of users in a range of conferences 
you specify.

insert

Use this sub-parameter if you wish to set the flags for the conference(s) you 
specify.  Using this parameter also requires that you use the first, last, 
lowsec, and highsec parameters.

remove

Use this sub-parameter if you wish to remove the flags for the conference(s) 
you specify.  Using this parameter also requires that you use the first, 
last, lowsec, and highsec parameters.

first:[conference number]

This sub-parameter specifies the first conference number in which users will 
have their flags modified.  This is always used in conjunction with the last 
sub-parameter to define the range of conferences to be acted upon.

last:[conference number]

This sub-parameter specifies the last conference number in which users will 
have their flags modified.  This is always used in conjunction with the first 
sub-parameter to define the range of conferences to be acted upon.

lowsec:[security level]

This sub-parameter is used to define the lowest security level which will be 
affected by the conference registration flag modifications.  When used in 
conjunction with the first, last, and highsec sub-parameters, the group of 
users who will have their conference registration flags modified is defined.

highsec:[security level]

This sub-parameter is used to define the highest security level which will be 
affected by the conference registration flag modifications.  When used in 
conjunction with the first, last, and highsec sub-parameters, the group of 
users who will have their conference registration flags modified is defined.

main

This sub-parameter enables you to either set or remove the conference 
registration flag (R).  Whether the flag is set or removed depends on whether 
you use the insert or remove sub-parameter.

expired

This sub-parameter enables you to set or remove the expired access flag (X).  
If you use the insert sub-parameter, the user will be given access to the 
conferences specified even if their subscription has expired.  If you use the 
remove sub-parameter, the users will not have access to the conference when 
their subscription expires (assuming you have subscription mode enabled).

NOTE:  Setting the X flag without having an R flag set will lock the user out 
of a conference.  If you really wish for a user to have non-expiring access 
to a particular conference, you should use the main sub-parameter in 
conjunction with the expired sub-parameter.

scan

This sub-parameter sets the scan conference flag (S).  Setting this flag 
selects the conference to be included in any message scans performed, and is 
similar in effect to the user SELECT command.  If a user is unable to join a 
conference where the S flag is set, the flag will be ignored and the 
conference will not be included in the scan.

reset

If this parameter is specified, the last message read pointer will be set to 
0 in the conferences specified by the first and last parameters.


        Example
                
        PCBSM /GROUP;insert;first:0;last:2,lowsec:20;highsec:30;main;expired

        This particular example will register users who have a security level 
        between 20 and 30 in conferences 0, 1, and 2.  In addition to being 
        registered, all users will be given access to the conference when 
        their subscription expires because the expired sub-parameter is used.



/INDEX

Use this parameter to re-index the user file.  For this operation all nodes 
do not have to be down.  Normally, you will not need to re-index the user 
file because PCBoard takes care of maintaining it.  However, there are 
circumstances that can occur in your system configuration (corrupt media, 
etc.)  which may corrupt your index files.


	Example

        PCBSM /INDEX

        This example will index the user file making sure that it is current.



/PACK

Packing your user file can do the following for you:

Insure the USERS, USERS.INF and user index files are all in sync with one 
another.

Remove users from your system who have not called in a specified amount of 
time.

Delete user records that have been marked for deletion or that have been 
locked out from the system.

If you do not use any sub-parameters, System Manager will insure that the 
USERS, USERS.INF, and user index files are in sync with one another.  Because 
this is a global change to the user file, all nodes must be down before 
selecting this option.  Otherwise, System Manger will continually try to open 
the USERS file.

remove

When this sub-parameter is specified, any user who has been marked for 
deletion (ALT-D when editing user records) or who has a security level of 0 
(locked out) will be physically removed from the user file.  If you do not 
want to remove users who are locked out from the system so as to prevent them 
from recreating a new account, use the lockout sub-parameter.

days:[number of days]

To help keep the size of your user file in check, you may wish to remove 
accounts of users who have not called in a certain number of days.  This 
sub-parameter gives you this ability. Replace [number of days] with the 
actual number of days to have elapsed since the user's last call to be 
considered an inactive account which may be purged from the user file.

since:[date]

This sub-parameter will remove users who have not accessed the system since 
the date you specify.  That date you specify must be in MMDDYY format where 
MM is the month, DD is the day, and YY is the year.

expdate:[date]

When you use this sub-parameter, any user who has an expiration date earlier 
than the one  you specify (MMDDYY format) will be removed from the user file.

keep:[security level]

This sub-parameter will prevent users who have the security level you specify 
(or higher) from being removed regardless of any criteria specified.

lockout

When you use this sub-parameter it will prevent any users who have been 
locked out of your system (security level 0) from being deleted.  Use this 
subparameter in conjunction with the remove sub-command.

print

Any users who are removed from the users file will be printed to the location 
you specified in System Manager | Define Printer Port


        Example

        PCBSM /PACK;remove;lockout;days:180

        The example above will remove any user who has been marked for 
        deletion or who has not called within the last 180 days. Because the 
        lockout parameter is specified, users who are locked out of your 
        system will not be deleted.



/PURGE

This command line parameter is identical to the /PACK parameter except the 
entire system does not need to be down to pack the users file.  This will 
enable you to perform an online pack of the users file without having to take 
the entire system down, which becomes increasingly difficult as you add more 
nodes to your system.

Any user who is online when the pack is performed will not be affected.  This 
means that even if the user would have been packed out with the criteria that 
you specified, the record will not be deleted because the  user was currently 
online.  This should not present much of a problem though, as you can pack 
the file again at a later time when the user is not online.

NOTE:  Online packing is disabled if you have installed the Alias PSA.


        Example

        PCBSM /PURGE;since:010194;keep:100

        The example above will remove any user who has not called since 
        January 1, 1994.  The keep parameter will insure that no users above 
        security level 100 will be removed.


/STANDARDIZE

Use this command line parameter if you plan on sorting your users file by 
phone number, or if you desire a more "standard" looking phone number format 
for all of your users.  When this parameter is specified, System Manager will 
strip all of the non-numerical data from the phone number fields and reformat 
it into the following format:


999 999-9999


If a number is shorter than 10 digits, System Manager will begin formatting 
from the right.  This means that if a user enters 5551212 for the phone 
number, it will be formatted as:


    555-1212


        Example

        PCBSM /STANDARDIZE

        Adjust the home/voice and business/data phone number fields to a 
        standard 999 999-9999 format.





/ADDTPA

This particular command line switch is designed for third party authors to 
use so they can easily install a TPA for their software without making you do 
all the hard work.  This is the format of the command line:

	/ADDTPA;[App_Name];[Version];[Static];[Dynamic];[Keyword]



  App_Name  The name of the application

  Version   The version number to install (digits only)

  Static    Represents the static size (in bytes) to allocate or 0 for none.

  Dynamic   Represents the number of bytes to allocate for each conference or 
            0 for none.

  Keyword   The keyword for the TPA.


For additional information on installing a TPA, please see Add/Update Third 
Party Application earlier in this section.


        Example

        PCBSM /ADDTPA;mail;10;128;1;mail

        Add a TPA with an application name of Mail and a version number "10".  
        128 bytes will be reserved for each user on the system with an 
        additional 1 byte per conference.  Finally, the keyword is mail.



/SORT

Sorting the user file gives you a quick method to access information.  For 
example, if you want to find out who has uploaded the most to your system, 
you can sort the user file by total number of bytes uploaded.  When a user 
file is sorted, you have all of the users in order based on how many bytes 
they have uploaded.  You can sort on a single field or with multiple fields.

When you sort on a single field, select an item such as the number of times a 
user has called the system.  System Manager will sort users by the total 
number of times they have called. If two users have called the same number of 
times, no attempt is made to put those users in any particular order.  If you 
wish to sort these users by name, do a multi-field sort.

Multi-field sorts, will sort any of the following fields:


Security level
Times ON
Files download
Files uploaded
File ratio
Bytes downloaded
Bytes uploaded
Byte ratio

When using a multi-field sort by security level and two or more users have 
the same security level, System Manager will sort these users who have the 
same security level alphabetically by name.  Once the users are sorted by 
name, it will move on to the next security level.  As a quick example, let's 
assume you have 5 users in your system:


JOHN SMITH	Security: 10
JIM JONES	Security: 20
SPENCER KORM	Security: 20
BILL GATES	Security: 0
PAUL BRAINERD	Security: 20

If you were to do a single field sort, the users will most
likely end up in this order:


BILL GATES	Security: 0
JOHN SMITH	Security: 10
JIM JONES	Security: 20
SPENCER KORM	Security: 20
PAUL BRAINERD	Security: 20


Notice that the security level 20 users are not sorted by name. While this 
does not present much of a problem for 5 users, it could be very annoying if 
you have 30,000 users on your system.

If you do a multi-field sort based instead on security level then on name, 
the five users will be sorted in the following order:

BILL GATES	Security: 0
JOHN SMITH	Security: 10
JIM JONES	Security: 20
PAUL BRAINERD	Security: 20
SPENCER KORM	Security: 20

With the exception of the prireverse and secreverse sub-parameters, all 
parameters specify types of sorts you can perform.  If you want to perform a 
multi-field sort, use name and any of the following:

security - Security level
timeson - Times on
dlfile - Files download
ulfile - Files uploaded
fratio - File ratio
dlbyte - Bytes downloaded
ulbyte - Bytes uploaded
bratio - Byte ratio

The following is a list of the many sub-parameters you can specify for this 
command line parameter:

name            Sort by user name field.

password        Sort by password field.

dataphone       Sort by the business/data phone number field.

homephone       Sort by the home/voice phone number field.

expdate         Sort by the expiration date of each user.

usercomment     Sort by the comment #1 field.

sysopcomment    Sort by the comment #2 field.

city            Sort by the city field.

security        Sort by the security level field.

timeson         Sort by the number of times the user has successfully logged 
                in.

dlfile          Sort by the number of files downloaded.

upfile          Sort by the number of files uploaded.

fratio          Sort by the file ratio. 

dlbyte          Sort by the number of bytes downloaded. 

upbyte          Sort by the number of bytes uploaded. 

bratio          Sort by the byte ratio. 

reverse         This sub-parameter is used when you sort by a single field.  
                If you use it, the records will be sorted in reverse order.  
                For example, if you sort by security level, the highest 
                security level will be first in the user file and the lowest 
                security level will be the last record in the file.

prireverse      This sub-parameter is used in conjunction with multiple field 
                sorts.  Normally sorts are performed in ascending order.  
                When you use this parameter, the primary sort field will be 
                sorted in descending order.

secreverse      Since the only field you can use as a secondary field is the 
                user name, this will cause any duplicates caught by the first 
                sort field to be sorted by name in reverse order.  This means 
                that William Plasger will be placed before Andrew Leaver.


        Examples
        
        PCBSM /SORT:security;reverse

        Sort the user file by security in reverse order placing those
        with the highest security level at the beginning of the file.

        PCBSM /SORT:dlbyte;name;prireverse

        Sort the user file by the number of bytes downloaded (in reverse 
        order) placing those who have downloaded the most towards the 
        beginning of the user file.  If two users have the same number of 
        bytes downloaded, they will be sorted by name to determine who should 
        be placed first in the user file.



/RETRY:[max number of retries]

This command line parameter specifies the number of attempts System Manager 
should retry on an error.  Most commonly, the error will occur when trying to 
access the USER file when all nodes are not down.  However, it is conceivable 
for the error to be an error reading from disk or other critical error.

When you are using the command line parameters to run System Manager in your 
event, this command line parameter can prove very useful.  With the exception 
of the /PURGE,  /INDEX, /RETRY, and /FILE command line parameters, all others 
require all nodes to be down before proceeding.  If all nodes are not down, 
System Manager will make continuous attempts every 10 seconds to access the 
USERS file until it becomes free.

Of course there is a real problem if you are trying to sort the user file in 
your 1:00 am event but one of  your nodes either failed to go down for the 
event or was improperly configured. If you were not to catch this until 7:00 
am the next morning, you could have lost 6 hours of dial-in time.  In a 
situation like this, using the /RETRY parameter to make 10 retry attempts and 
then exit to DOS (returning control to your event batch file) is very 
advantageous.


	Example

	PCBSM /PACK;remove /RETRY:20

        The example above would pack the users file removing any user   that 
        has been marked for deletion or who has a security level of 0.  
        Should an error occur, 20 attempts will be made before System Manager 
        will finally abort the attempt.


/FILE:[location of PCBOARD.DAT]

System Manager needs to access the PCBOARD.DAT file so it can determine where 
your user files (and other configuration files) are stored.  Normally, System 
Manager will only look in the current directory for the PCBOARD.DAT file.  
However, you can tell it where to find the file by using this command line 
parameter.

Simply replace [location of PCBOARD.DAT] with the full path and filename 
where it can be found (e.g., C:\PCB\PCBOARD.DAT).


        Example

        PCBSM /FILE:H:\SHARE\PCBOARD.DAT

        The example above will load System Manager and specify that it should 
        use the PCBOARD.DAT located in H:\SHARE to find the information about 
        PCBoard.

This chapter discusses the various batch files used by PCBoard including any 
special information you should know about these files.  PCBoard uses numerous 
batch files to increase its flexibility.  Because batch files are used 
throughout PCBoard you can control the programs that are actually run. If you 
are unfamiliar with batch files, please refer to your DOS manual for further 
instructions on creating batch files.

Door Batch Files

One of the most flexible aspects of PCBoard is its ability to run 
applications as door programs.  As mentioned previously, a door simply 
executes a batch file.  Since it is a batch file, you can run anything for a 
door.  However, if you want the door to interact with the user, you must 
insure that the program supports the serial ports you have installed on your 
machine. If you are using the multiport version of PCBoard and COMM-TSR, the 
program that you want to interact with the user must support the FOSSIL 
interface.

In the DOORS.LST file for each conference, you specify the batch file that 
will be run when the user opens the door.  To find out the filename and the 
location of the batch file, combine the Filename and Path to DOOR files 
fields.  The following entry requires that you edit C:\PCB\QUERY to modify 
the batch file:

                                   USER DOOR
  Filename    Password   Sec Login SYS  SYS  Shell    Path to DOOR Files
 ---------- ------------ --- ----- ---- ---- ----- ---------------------
1) QUERY                   0   N    Y    N     N   C:\PCB\

Notice that there is no BAT extension that is usually associated with a batch 
file.  Rather than editing the batch file from the DOS prompt, you can 
highlight the Filename field and press F2 to use the text editor defined in 
System Manager.

Event Batch Files

Each event can have a batch file for each node.  If a node-specific batch 
file is not defined, it will run the batch file without an extension.  For 
example, if you have the following event defined

               Batch     Begin  End
     Act  Mod  File      Time   Time
     ---  ---  --------  -----  -----
1)    Y    E   DAILY     06:45  07:00

and the location of your event batch files are:

Location of EVENT Files               : C:\PCB\EVENTS\

you would need to edit the C:\PCB\EVENTS\DAILY to modify the programs that 
will run during your event.  As with door batch files, you will notice that 
this batch file does not have a BAT extension.  This gives you the ability to 
create node-specific batch files, if you have different nodes performing 
different tasks.

Hypothetically, you could have one node packing the message and user files 
while other nodes run maintenance programs for door or other utility programs 
you have installed.  To perform this in a two node system, you would create 
the following batch files:

DAILY.001
DAILY.002

The extension specified represents the node number that the batch file will 
run on.  Under no circumstances will DAILY.001 run on node 2 or likewise 
DAILY.002 on node 1.  If a node cannot find a node-specific event batch file 
it will check to see if a batch file exists without the node number 
extension.  If it exists, that batch file will run.  If it does not, the node 
will not run the event.

External File Transfer 
Protocols

Even though 8 file transfer protocols are provided with PCBoard (7 internal 
and 1 external), you may need to add additional protocols to satisfy the 
needs of your users.  Any protocols that you add to the system are called 
external protocols. External protocols require two batch files to be created 
before the protocol will be available to your callers -- one for receiving 
and one for sending.  In the batch files, you will need to run the external 
protocol program.  Most external protocols ship with one executable and you 
use command line parameters to determine if the protocol is sending or 
receiving.

Protocols are defined by a letter or digit in PCBPROT.DAT (PCBSetup | File 
Locations | Configuration Files).  The receive batch file will be named using 
the following convention:

PCBR[protocol letter].BAT

Likewise, the send batch file will be named:

PCBS[protocol letter].BAT

In these examples, replace [protocol letter] with the character you entered 
in the Use column of PCBPROT.DAT to define the protocol.

Because there are so many external protocols, no specific instructions can be 
given for installing the protocols.  To help interface with the external 
protocol, PCBoard passes parameters to the batch file.

Parameters Passed

To use a parameter in your batch file, enter the parameter when you want to 
use what it represents.  For example, %1 for external protocols will return 
the COM port number defined in PCBSetup | Modem Information | Modem Setup. If 
your protocol needs this information, place %1 in the appropriate place in 
your batch file.  The parameters passed to external protocols are:

        %1      Returns the COM port number defined in PCBSetup | Modem 
                Information | Modem Setup.  If you are using standard serial 
                ports with non-standard definitions for the base address or 
                IRQ, you will need to provide that information to the 
                protocol yourself because PCBoard does not provide this 
                information.

        %2      Returns the speed between the modem and the computer.  This 
                is commonly referred to as the DTE speed.  For modems which 
                support locked port rates, the value of %2 will be the 
                opening port rate speed defined in PCBSetup | Modem 
                Information | Modem Setup.

        %3      Specifies the file(s) to transfer.  The actual text that is 
                passed as the parameter varies depending on the type of 
                protocol and whether files are being sent or received.

                Batch file transfers (Protocol types D and B):  When sending 
                a single file, the location of the file will be passed.  When 
                sending more than one file, the filenames that are to be 
                transferred will be provided in a carriage return / line feed 
                delimited list.  An @ sign is specified before the filename 
                to the list as it is the most common way to refer to such a 
                list. Check to make sure that your external protocol supports 
                this method.  When receiving files, the private upload 
                directory for the current conference will be passed.

                Non-batch file transfers (Protocol type S):  The filename to 
                be sent or received is always specified.

        %4      Returns the connect speed as reported by PCBoard. 
                Error-correcting modems will report the locked port rate 
                speed. Other connections will report the carrier speed.
                
        %5      Returns the connect speed as reported by the modem.  This is 
                referred to as the carrier or DCE speed.

        %6      Returns the private upload directory for the current 
                conference.  This parameter is most commonly used in 
                conjunction with bi-directional protocol because they need to 
                know where the upload directory is even while 
                downloading.
                
NODE.BAT

In addition to displaying who is online to the system, PCBMoni has the 
capability to run a batch file for a particular node. Why would you want to 
do this?  Most networks have what is called a spy utility.  This utility 
enables you to spy on another machine in the network. Typically, you can view 
the screen of this machine and take control of the keyboard. Obviously, this 
would be handy to be able to access.

When scrolling through the list of nodes in PCBMoni, you can press ENTER on 
any node and PCBoard will run NODE.BAT.  So that you know the node number 
that was specified, PCBoard will pass two parameters to NODE.BAT. You should 
use these parameters when calling your spy utility.

Parameters Passed

%1              The node number is specified as Node[number] where [number] 
                is replaced by the node number you pressed ENTER on.  The 
                following are examples of what will be passed:

                        Node 3
                        Node 4
                        Node 5


%2              The node number with no preceding text is passed to the batch 
                file.  The following are examples of what will be passed:


                        3
                        4
                        5
        
PCBCMPRS.BAT

If you will recall, the R user command has a Z subcommand that can be used to 
capture messages in a compressed format.  To compress the captured messages, 
PCBoard will execute PCBCMPRS.BAT with two parameters.

Parameters Passed

        %1      Returns the target filename.  PCBoard uses the capture 
                filename that you enter in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | 
                Messages and the extension specified in PCBSetup | File 
                Locations | Configuration Files.

        %2      Returns the source filename.  This will be the filename that 
                PCBoard temporarily captured the messages to.

If your file compression program uses the following syntax


COMPRESS -a [target filename] [source filename]


you would create a PCBCMPRS.BAT which looks like this:


COMPRESS -a %1 %2


If the target filename does not exist when PCBCMPRS.BAT is done executing, 
PCBoard will report that there was an error compressing the file.  If you see 
this error message, check the syntax of your batch file and make sure that 
you have used the parameters properly.

NOTE:  PCBoard ships with a PCBCMPRS.BAT that is already setup for use with 
PKWare's PKZIP (R) compression program.

PCBQWK.BAT

To create QWK packets and to uncompress REP packets, PCBoard will execute 
PCBQWK.BAT.  There are four parameters that will be passed to the PCBQWK 
batch file.

Parameters Passed

        %1      Either COMPRESS or EXTRACT is returned in all upper case. 
                When COMPRESS is returned, a QWK packet is being created.  
                When EXTRACT is returned, the user uploaded a REP packet and 
                it needs to be uncompressed so that PCBoard can insert the 
                messages.

        %2      Returns the target filename to be compressed or extracted. 
                The actual filename will be taken from PCBSetup | 
                Configuration Options | Messages.  If a QWK packet is being 
                created, QWK will be added to the filename.  Likewise, if a 
                REP packet is being uncompressed, REP will be added to the 
                filename.

        %3      Returns the work directory specified in PCBSetup | File 
                Locations | System Files.

        %4      Returns a filename that lists the files that need to be 
                included in the QWK packet.  Most compression programs 
                usually have some method for accepting file lists.  Check 
                your manual for further details.


A sample PCBQWK.BAT might resemble the following:


if %1==COMPRESS compress %2 @%4
if %1==EXTRACT uncompres %2 %3


NOTE:  PCBoard ships with a PCBCMPRS.BAT that is already setup for use 
with PKWare's PKZIP® compression program.

PCBTEST.BAT

One major concern of most system operators is the spread of harmful computer 
viruses and trojans through electronic means such as bulletin board systems. 
Another concern is to make sure that all files uploaded pass integrity tests 
especially if the file is compressed.  If you want, you can configure PCBoard 
to test each file that is uploaded to the system.  If you want PCBoard to do 
this, you must enable the Verify Uploads switch in PCBSetup | Configuration 
Options | File Transfers. When upload verification is enabled, PCBoard will 
execute PCBTEST.BAT with three parameters.

Parameters Passed

        %1      Returns the complete drive, path, and filename of the file 
                that should be tested.

        %2      Returns one of three responses.  If UPLOAD is returned, the 
                file being tested has just been uploaded and consequently is 
                a new file to the system.  If TEST is returned, a user is 
                using the TEST user command to verify the integrity of the 
                file presumably before downloading it.  If ATTACH is 
                returned, the file was uploaded to the system as a file 
                attachment.  You can use the response to determine what type 
                of tests (if any) should be used on the file.

        %3      When %2 returns UPLOAD, this parameter will return the 
                location of the filename that contains the description 
                entered by the user.  Programs can modify this description 
                file and PCBoard will import the changes back into the file 
                directory when posting the file.

Returning Status of File Tested

Once PCBTEST.BAT has been executed, PCBoard checks to see if either 
PCBPASS.TXT or PCBFAIL.TXT exists in the current directory.  The existence of 
one of these files determines whether or not the file passed the tests.

If PCBFAIL.TXT exists, PCBoard will display the contents of the file and then 
fail the upload.  The file that was uploaded will remain in the private 
upload directory for the conference and a FILE FAILED VERIFICATION CHECK line 
will be added to the description of the file.  In addition, if a file 
description is modified (%3) and the file fails verification, PCBoard will 
not add the FILE FAILED VERICATION CHECK line to the description.

If PCBPASS.TXT exists, PCBoard will display the contents of the file.  If you 
have defined any upload or byte credits for uploads in PCBSetup | 
Configuration Options | File Transfers, those credits will be issued.

In the event that both PCBPASS.TXT and PCBFAIL.TXT exist, PCBFAIL.TXT will 
take precedence.  In fact, any time that a PCBFAIL.TXT exists, the file will 
be failed.

NOTE:  The PCBTEST.BAT that comes with your copy of PCBoard will test the 
integrity of ARC, ARJ, and ZIP compressed files.  If you want to do virus 
scanning and other tasks, you will need to use a third-party program that 
will help you do this or modify the batch file yourself.

PCBVIEW.BAT

In addition to testing a file before downloading it, a user may want to view 
the contents of the file.  The user can view a file while listing file 
descriptions or by entering F;V at the conference command prompt.

When the user views a file, PCBoard executes the batch file that is specified 
in the Batch file for viewing compressed files field of  PCBSetup | File 
Locations | Configuration Files.  By default, this filename is called 
PCBVIEW.BAT.  When executing this batch file, only one parameter is passed to 
the batch file.

Parameter Passed

        %1      Returns the full drive, path, and filename of the filename 
                that has been requested for viewing.

After Execution of The Batch File

After the batch file has been executed, PCBoard checks for the existence of 
PCBVIEW.TXT in the current directory.  The contents of this file will be 
displayed to the caller.  If it does not exist, it is assumed that an error 
occurred when viewing the file.

NOTE:  The PCBVIEW.BAT that has been supplied with your copy of PCBoard, will 
list the files that are stored in ZIP, ARJ, ARC, and PAK compressed files. In 
addition, it will view any filename that has a TXT extension to the screen.  
If you examine the default PCBVIEW.BAT, you will notice that it uses 
TESTFILE.EXE (also included with your copy of PCBoard) to determine the 
extension of the filename and branch to an appropriate part in the batch 
file.

REMOTE.SYS

When you request a remote drop to DOS using the 9 SysOp command, PCBoard will 
use REMOTE.SYS as a batch file.  Therefore, you can have REMOTE.SYS load just 
about anything you desire to drop to DOS.

You will need to run some sort of program that will redirect a local DOS 
session to a serial port because DOS does not provide this capability. 
Included with your PCBoard package is a shareware copy of DOORWAY by TriMark 
Engineering and a REMOTE.SYS that is pre-configured to use DOORWAY on COM1. 
This program has the capability of redirecting text screens to a standard 
serial or FOSSIL port.  The ASCII version of the DOORWAY documentation is 
included in a file called DOORWAY.ZIP in your \PCB directory in case you want 
to make any changes to the default REMOTE.SYS.

In order to return back to PCBoard, your REMOTE.SYS should reload the proper 
BOARD.BAT file.  If you do not load BOARD.BAT or if you load the wrong 
BOARD.BAT, you could cause your entire system or a node on your system to 
remain off-line until you get a chance to correct the mistake.

$$LOGON.BAT

Similar to $$LOGOFF.BAT, you can use $$LOGON.BAT to do special processing 
after a user has logged into the system.   Once the user has properly entered 
their name, and password, PCBoard will execute $$LOGON.BAT if it can be 
found.  There really is no restriction on what you can run in this batch 
file, but as a general rule, keep it short so that the callers do not have 
excessive delays when logging in.

$$LOGOFF.BAT

If you need to do special processing after each caller has disconnected from 
the system, you can use a program called $$LOGOFF.BAT.  PCBoard checks for 
the existence of this file in the current directory and in each directory in 
your PATH= statement.  If it is found, it will be run after the caller has 
been disconnected and all files except PCBOARD.SYS have been closed.

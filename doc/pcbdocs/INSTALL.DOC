Detailed Installation Instructions




For PCBoard to operate properly, you must install it on your system.  The 
installation program provided on disk #1 will insure that PCBoard is properly 
installed.  If you are installing PCBoard for the first time or upgrading a 
previous version, the installation program will get you running in a minimal 
amount of time.

Quick Install

If you have previously installed a version of PCBoard or are very familiar 
with installing a bulletin board, this section will provide you with only the 
necessary information that you will need to install PCBoard.  If you require 
explanations of each of the questions that the install program will ask you, 
skip to the Detailed Installation Instructions section of this chapter.

PCBoard is supplied on both 3.5" and 5.25" disks.  Both disk sets are the 
same.  Select the disk size appropriate to your machine and insert Disk #1 
into your A or B drive as required. At the DOS prompt, enter:

    a:install  (ENTER)  (if using Drive A)

    or

    b:install  (ENTER)  (if using Drive B)

The installation program will then ask you for the destination of your 
PCBoard installation on your hard disk (defaulting to C:\PCB), as well as 
verifying the source location of the installation disks (A or B above).

If you are upgrading from a previous version of PCBoard, or installing a 
registered copy of PCBoard in place of a demo copy, the installation program 
will automatically recognize your previous installation and will only update 
the necessary files required for the upgrade. In either case, the install 
program will not modify your previous configuration.

Continue with the installation by following the instructions that are 
displayed on the screen.  When the installation is complete, change to the 
directory where you installed PCBoard and run BOARD.BAT.

Detailed Installation Instructions

PCBoard can be installed directly from the distribution disks, or from a 
temporary location on your hard disk.  If you will be installing several 
copies of PCBoard on multiple machines in a network environment, it is 
suggested that you install from a temporary location on your main file 
server.  For additional information on installing more than one node, refer 
to the Multiple Nodes chapter of this manual once PCBoard is installed.

If you are installing PCBoard for the first time, you will be asked to enter 
information regarding the System Operator (SysOp) - including their name, 
remote logon password, etc. Please be prepared to complete this information 
during the initial installation.

If you have downloaded a new release of PCBoard from Salt Air, follow the 
instructions under Upgrading a Current Installation from Hard Disk Files 
found later in this section.

At any time during the installation procedure, you may press E when a prompt 
is displayed to abort the installation.  Files which have already been 
installed will not be removed from your hard disk.  If you abort an initial 
installation and perform a subsequent complete installation, do not select 
the upgrade option since all files may not have been installed during the 
initial aborted install.  Instead, tell the install program that you are 
performing a new installation to ensure all files are properly installed on 
your system.

Installing from the Distribution Disks

PCBoard is supplied on both 3.5" and 5.25" high-density disks. Both disk sets 
contain the same information.  Select the disk size appropriate to your 
machine and insert Disk #1 into your A or B drive as required.  At the DOS 
prompt, enter:

    a:install  (ENTER)  (if using Drive A)

    or

    b:install  (ENTER)  (if using Drive B)

If you are upgrading from a previous version of PCBoard, or installing a 
registered copy of PCBoard in place of a demo copy, the installation program 
will automatically recognize your previous installation and will only update 
the necessary files required for the upgrade.  In either case, the install 
program will not modify your previous configuration.

The installation program will then ask the following two questions:

Are you installing from a Floppy Drive ?  Y 
Installing from Floppy Drive (A or B): ?  A

You should enter a Y at the Are you installing from a Floppy Drive question, 
and enter the floppy drive letter you are installing from at the Installing 
from Floppy Drive (A or B) question.  You may skip the next section, 
Installing from Hard Disk Files, and proceed with the section entitled 
Installation Instructions Common to All Installation Methods.

Installing from Hard Disk Files

NOTE:  If you are installing PCBoard for the first time, you will be asked to 
enter information regarding the System Operator (SysOp) - including their 
name, remote logon password, etc. Please be prepared to complete this 
information during the initial installation.

PCBoard is supplied on both 3.5" and 5.25" high-density disks. Both disk sets 
contain the same information.  Select the disk size appropriate to your 
machine and insert Disk #1 into your A or B drive as required. Next, decide 
on a temporary location on your hard disk to which you will be copying the 
distribution disks.  This location must not be the same location that you 
will be installing PCBoard to.  Next, copy the appropriate size distribution 
disks to that location by using the DOS COPY command.  For example, if your 
temporary drive location is D:\TEMP, at the DOS prompt, enter:

    COPY A:\*.* D:\TEMP  (ENTER)

Repeat the above procedure for each distribution disk of the size chosen.  
Next, switch to your temporary file location and execute the install program.  
Assuming that you copied the files on the distribution disk to D:\TEMP, you 
would enter the following:

    d:       (ENTER)
    cd\temp  (ENTER)
    install  (ENTER)

If you are upgrading from a previous version of PCBoard, or installing a 
registered copy of PCBoard in place of a demo copy, the installation program 
will automatically recognize your previous installation and will only update 
the necessary files required for the upgrade.  In either case, the install 
program will not modify your previous configuration.

The installation program will then ask the following question:

    Are you installing from a Floppy Drive ?  N

You should enter an N at the Are you installing from a Floppy Drive question 
which tells the installation program to proceed with the remainder of the 
installation without prompting for a floppy drive location.

Installation Instructions Common to All Installation Methods

Next, the installation program will display a screen briefly describing the 
installation process and will ask you to complete the following three 
questions:

Do you want to proceed with the installation ? 
Enter your destination drive (C) through (Z) ? 
Enter the directory path to install ? 

At the Do you want to proceed with the installation? prompt, reply with a Y 
unless you do not have the required System Operator (SysOp) information 
available which includes the SysOp name and password to be used for local 
login.

At the Enter your destination drive (C) through (Z)? prompt, enter the hard 
disk drive location on which PCBoard will be installed.  The drive that you 
enter should be a physical drive, not a ram drive or other temporary drive.

At the Enter the directory path to install? prompt, enter the subdirectory or 
path location on the drive previously indicated that you wish the PCBoard 
files to be installed to.  This location defaults to \PCB.  Unless you have a 
specific reason to change this location, it is strongly suggested that you 
accept the default location since PCBoard defaults to the \PCB location.  If 
you change this location from the \PCB default, you will have to manually 
change all of the program defaults inside PCBSetup once the installation is 
complete.

After completing the above, the installation program will create the 
following subdirectories on the destination drive you have specified and in 
general will contain the files indicated (if you accept the default install 
location of \PCB):

        \PCB            Program executable files, system batch files, and 
                        node specific data  files

        \DL01           Can be used to place downloadable files here

        \PCB\GEN        Used to store system text files, menus, bulletins, 
                        and file listings

	\PCB\HELP	Used to store system help files

        \PCB\MAIN       Used to store USERS and MSGS files as well as other 
                        sensitive system files which need to be protected 
                        from downloading

        \PCB\CONVERT    Used to store conversion files which contain 
                        instructions on converting 12.x and earlier versions 
                        of PCBoard

	\PCB\UPLOAD	Used to store new public uploads to your system

	\PCB\PRIVUPLD	Used to store new private uploads to your system

Once the necessary subdirectories have been created, the installation program 
will copy and expand the files from the distribution disks to their 
appropriate locations on your hard disk.  After all files have been 
successfully installed, the program will ask you the following:

Did you purchase a registered DOORWAY ?  N

DOORWAY is an advanced serial and local screen I/O redirector which can be 
used to support remote DOS operations for the system operator as well as for 
running applications as a door. which have not been specifically written to 
operate as a door.. A non-registered version of the software is provided with 
your copy of PCBoard.  If you have purchased a fully registered copy of 
DOORWAY with your copy of PCBoard and you have the registered DOORWAY disk 
available, answer Y to this question.  Otherwise, accept the default of N and 
continue the installation process.

At a later date, you can purchase a registered copy of DOORWAY if desired.  
To update your configuration with the registered copy, replace the 
DOORWAY.EXE file in the directory where you installed PCBoard with the 
DOORWAY.EXE on your registered version disk.

NOTE:  The non-registered version of DOORWAY that is supplied with your copy 
of PCBoard is limited to 10 minutes of activity each time you run it.  Once 
the 10 minutes are up, you will be returned to PCBoard.

The installation program will then ask the following question:

Will you be running in a multitasking environment such as
DESQview, TaskView or OmniView or DoubleDOS (Y/N) ?  N

If you will be running multiple nodes on one machine under any of the above 
multitasking programs (including Windows or OS/2), you should answer Y to 
this question.  If you answer Y, the installation program will automatically 
adjust your default COM port opening speed to insure proper multi-node modem 
operation. If at a later time you wish to adjust your COM port opening speed 
to either a higher or lower setting, you can do so using PCBSetup.

After indicating whether you will be running in a multitasking environment, 
the installation program will check your CONFIG.SYS file to insure you have a 
sufficient number of file handles defined for proper program operation.  Each 
PCBoard node requires approximately 25 file handles for operation.  If the 
installation program detects an insufficient number of handles, you will be 
asked if you wish to update your CONFIG.SYS file with an appropriate FILES= 
statement.  If you do not allow the install program to update your CONFIG.SYS 
file, be sure to manually update it before attempting to run PCBoard.

Next, the program will ask you to complete the System Operator (SysOp) 
information by asking the following questions:

What is your first name ?
What is your last name ?
City/State Information ?
Password for remote login ?

The password you enter in this screen will be the one the SysOp uses for 
remote access to this system.  Since the integrity of the system can be 
jeopardized by unauthorized access, you should enter a password which is not 
used for accessing other systems. In other words, the password entered should 
be unique to this system only!

After completing the above, the program will create the system's USERS file 
and associated index files.  This screen must be completed before attempting 
to access your system since the required USERS file information will not be 
present unless the above screen is properly completed.

The installation program will now ask if you wish to configure a modem for 
operation by asking the following:

   Do you wish to Install a MODEM (Y/N) ?

In order to configure your modem at this time, it must be connected to your 
hardware and be powered on.  If you do not have a modem connected, reply with 
an N to skip this operation. If you do have a modem, and it is connected and 
powered up, reply with a Y.  The installation program will then run PCBModem 
which will setup your modem properly.  For more information on PCBModem, 
refer to the Utilities chapter of this manual.  

Once you have selected and initialized your modem, you will be returned to 
the PCBModem menu.  Press E until you are informed that PCBSetup will be run.  
This is the next step in the installation process.

Next, the installation program will run PCBSetup so that you can alter some 
of the finer details of your configuration.  If you are installing PCBoard 
for the first time, it is suggested that you immediately exit from PCBSetup 
without altering any of the default settings until you have reviewed the 
chapters in this manual which detail PCBSetup.  To exit PCBoard without 
making changes, press E, and answer N to the question that you are asked.  

Altering PCBoard's defaults at this time, without having a complete 
understanding of the overall operation of the program, can cause frustration 
in trying to put things back to their default settings at a later time.

Finally, the installation program will ask if you wish to view the WHATSNEW 
and Q&A.TXT (Questions and Answers) files.  If you do, simply respond with a 
Y to both prompts and you will be shown the two files for review.

After completing the installation process, you are ready to run PCBoard by 
entering:

   board  (ENTER)

at the DOS prompt in the directory where you installed PCBoard.

NOTE:  If you need to setup more than one node of PCBoard, proceed to the 
Multiple Nodes chapter of this manual for additional information.

Upgrading a Current Installation from Hard Disk Files

If you have already installed a demo version of PCBoard, or are upgrading 
your current registered version of PCBoard with a newer version, copy the 
upgrade files and/or disks supplied to a temporary location on your hard 
disk.  This location must not be the same location as your current program 
location.  For example, Using the location D:\TEMP as your temporary 
location, you would copy or place the files downloaded from the Salt Air BBS, 
or the disks supplied, to that location.

Next, change directories to the location where you copied the upgrade files 
and type:

d:        (ENTER)
cd \temp  (ENTER)
install   (ENTER)

Tell the installation program you are not installing from a floppy drive.  
When asked to enter the destination drive and path location for the software, 
enter the location of your current PCBoard files.  At this point, the 
installation program will display a screen indicating that you have already 
installed PCBoard and ask if you wish to perform a new installation or an 
upgrade:

Would you like to Upgrade or install a New system (U/N) ?   U

If you are doing a first-time reinstall of the software due a previously 
aborted installation, enter N.  Otherwise, enter U for upgrade.  Entering U 
will only upgrade the necessary files on your system, leaving all other 
configuration and data files intact.

CAUTION:  DO NOT SELECT A NEW INSTALLATION IF YOU ARE SIMPLY UPGRADING A 
CURRENT SYSTEM AS ALL CURRENT DATA FILES WILL BE OVER-WRITTEN.

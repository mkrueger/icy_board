To load PCBoard, type BOARD at the DOS command prompt.  This will 
execute the BOARD.BAT that is installed in your \PCB directory.  When 
PCBoard is loaded, it will present the call waiting screen to you.


The first part of this chapter discusses the call-waiting screen.  The 
rest of the sections in this chapter discuss the command line parameters 
and switches you can use to load PCBoard, the status line, and potential 
problems that you can run into while attempting to load PCBoard.

Call Waiting Screen

The call waiting screen is shown only to you, the SysOp.  From this 
screen, you can access all of the important PCBoard configuration 
utilities and modify some of the ways that PCBoard operates.  There are 
fifteen buttons on the call-waiting screen that define the action that 
will be taken.

Navigating

When the call waiting screen is displayed, you will notice that the 
Sysop - Busy button is highlighted.  You can move the highlight bar 
around the call-waiting screen by using the following keys:

        Left    Left.  Move the highlight bar one button to the left.  
                If the highlight bar is at the left-most button on the 
                row, the highlight bar will not move.

        Right   Right.  Move the highlight bar one button to the right.  
                If the highlight bar is highlighting the rightmost 
                button on the row, the bar will not move.

        Down    Down.  Move the highlight bar one button down.  If the 
                highlight bar is on the bottom button, the bar will not 
                move.

        Up      Up.  Move the highlight bar one row up.  If you are at 
                the top of a column of buttons, the highlight bar will 
                not move.

        ENTER   Execute option.  The button that is currently 
                highlighted will be executed.  For example, if the Sysop 
                - Busy button is highlighted when you press R, you will 
                log in as the SysOp and the phone will be made busy.

Options Explained

The following describes each of the buttons available on the 
call-waiting screen:

User - Busy

Selecting this button or pressing 2 enables you to login locally as a 
user.. The display will change to approximate what would be viewed if 
you called in using a modem.  The only difference is that the status 
line is visible.  In addition, the phone line for this node will be made 
busy (if a COM port has been selected).

User - Not Busy

This button is identical to the User - Busy button, except that the 
phone line will not be made busy.  If someone calls while you are logged 
in, PCBoard will make a ringing sound and print a notice on the status 
line to let you know that you should log off.

Sysop - Busy

This button allows you to log in locally to PCBoard as the SysOp.  The 
graphics, name, and password prompts are all skipped to allow for 
quicker logins.  PCBoard will make its best attempt to approximate the 
display that a remote caller would see on their screen.  The only 
difference is that the status line is visible.  In addition, the phone 
line for this node will be made busy (if a COM port has been selected).

Sysop - Not Busy

This button is identical to the Sysop - Busy button, except that the 
phone line will not be made busy.  If someone calls, while you are 
logged in, PCBoard will make a ringing sound and print a notice on the 
status line to let you know that you should log off.

DOS - Busy

Selecting this button or pressing 1 will exit PCBoard and return to DOS.  
The phone line will be made busy preventing users from being able to 
login to the node.

DOS - Not Busy

This button will exit PCBoard and return to DOS.  The phone line will 
not be busy meaning that callers will hear the phone continually ring.  
If you prefer to use keyboard short-cuts, you can press 0 or E instead 
of selecting this button.

Printer

Selecting this button or pressing 3 will toggle the printer status.

        Off     The information that is written to the caller log will 
                not be sent to the printer port.

        On      Anything that is written to the caller log will also be 
                written to the printer port defined in PCBSetup | Node 
                Configuration.

Page Bell

Selecting this button or pressing 4 will toggle your chat status to be 
either on or off.

        Off     Users will be told that the SysOp is not available for 
                chat if they use the O user command.  Instead, they are 
                asked if they would rather leave a comment to the SysOp.

        On      When the page bell is turned on, users will be able to 
                page you for chatting if they attempt to page between 
                the hours defined in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | 
                Limits.  If paged, you will be beeped for 30 seconds.  
                You can then choose to answer the page by pressing M or 
                to ignore the page.  If you do not answer, the user will 
                be asked if they wish to leave a comment to the SysOp.

Alarm

Selecting this button or pressing 7 will toggle the alarm status to be 
either on or off.  While a caller is online (either local or via modem), 
PCBoard will beep when an invalid command is entered, at the beginning 
of the call, and when the automatic logoff for inactivity is about to 
occur.  The setting of the alarm will determine if the beeps will be 
heard on the local computer only -- remote callers will always be sent 
beeps.


        Off     The beeps will not be heard on the local computer but 
                they will be heard on the remote computer.

        On      The beeps will be heard on both the local computer and 
                the remote computer.

PCBSysMgr

Pressing this button or ALT-S will load System Manager.  See the System 
Manager chapter for further details.  As long as you use BOARD.BAT to 
load PCBoard, you will return to the call waiting screen when you exit 
System Manager.

PCBFiler

Pressing this button or ALT-D will load PCBFiler.  See the PCBFiler 
chapter for further details.  As long as you use BOARD.BAT to load 
PCBoard, you will return to the call waiting screen when you exit 
PCBFiler.

PCBSetup

This button will load PCBSetup.  As long as you use BOARD.BAT to load 
PCBoard, you will return to the call waiting screen when you exit 
PCBSetup.

Statistics

The call waiting screen keeps track of the last caller, and number of 
calls, messages, and file transfers since being reset by the Reset Stats 
switch.  This button toggles the statistics that are displayed on the 
call waiting screen between local and system status.


	Local	All statistic totals refer to the current node only.
	System	All statistic totals refer to all of the nodes in your
                system.

NOTE:  The statistics will not be updated on local logins if the Exclude 
Local Logins from Stats option is enabled in PCBSetup | Configuration 
Options | Switches.

PCBMoni

When this button is selected or you press ALT-M, PCBMoni will be loaded.  
See the Utilities chapter in this manual for further details.  PCBoard 
shells to PCBMoni so you will always be returned to the call waiting 
screen when you exit.

Reset Stats

Selecting this button will reset the last caller, and the number of 
calls, messages, and file transfers.  If you are displaying LOCAL 
statistics, only that node's statistics will be reset.  If you are 
viewing SYSTEM statistics, all nodes will be reset.  You may want to do 
this on a regular basis to help keep tabs of how active your system is.

Additional Keyboard Commands

In addition to the buttons on the call waiting screen, there are two 
keyboard commands that are available:

        F8      Recycle node.  Using this keyboard command will cause 
                PCBoard to recycle the node and re-initialize the modem.

        F9      Toggle screen display.  This keyboard command will 
                toggle the status of the screen.  When the screen is 
                off, no information is printed on the screen (leaving 
                the entire screen black). Otherwise, the normal 
                information you would see is displayed on the screen.

Command Line Parameters

Command line parameters give you the ability to modify certain ways that 
PCBoard will behave.  The following is a brief listing of what some of 
the command line parameters do:

Automatically assume a local login and skip the call-waiting screen.

Assume that the call has already been answered by a front-end program 
and continue with the connection.

Usually, you will modify your BOARD.BAT file to include the command line 
parameters that you want to use.  Use a text editor to modify the 
PCBOARD line in the batch file.  To add one or more command line 
parameters, specify them after PCBOARD as shown in the following:


if exist endpcb del endpcb
PCBOARD /LOCALON /KEY:y;q^M
if exist remote.bat remote

Notice that two command line parameters were specified on this line.  To 
separate the parameters, a space is used after PCBOARD and also after 
the first parameter.

/C:[carrier speed]

If you run a front-end program that answers the call, you need to inform 
PCBoard that the call has already been answered by using this parameter.  
When this parameter is used, the carrier speed of the connection must be 
supplied.  If you do not specify a valid carrier speed, PCBoard will 
print


Invalid use of /C: switch
Exiting to DOS!


and return back to DOS.  When a valid carrier speed is specified, 
PCBoard will check the port to make sure that carrier is detected on the 
serial port that PCBoard is defined to use before allowing the user to 
login.  If carrier cannot be found, PCBoard will notify you and then 
exit.

Example

PCBOARD /C:14400

/ERR

This parameter tells PCBoard that the connection that has been 
established by a front-end program is an error-correcting session.  
Users who have error-correcting sessions are able to select file 
transfer protocols that require error-correcting sessions.  You must use 
this parameter in conjunction with the /C parameter to have any effect.

Example

PCBOARD /C:14400 /ERR

/EVENT:[minutes to event]

If you have a front-end program answer all of the calls, PCBoard will 
not be in control of running events.  Instead, it is up to your 
front-end program to run all of your events for you.  To help insure 
that all callers have logged off by the time your front-end program is 
ready to run the event, PCBoard uses this parameter

You must specify the number of minutes after the user has connected that 
the event is scheduled to run.  Most front-end programs will set an 
environment variable with this value.

Example

Assuming that your front-end program sets an environment
variable called EVENTIME with the number of minutes until the
next event occurs, you would use the following line in BOARD.BAT:

PCBOARD /EVENT:%EVENTIME%

NOTE:  If you are unfamiliar with using environment variables in batch 
files, refer to your DOS manual for a detailed description.

/FILE:[location of PCBOARD.DAT]

By default, PCBoard will assume that its configuration file 
(PCBOARD.DAT) is located in the current directory.  If you attempt to 
load PCBoard from a directory that does not have a PCBOARD.DAT, you will 
receive this message:

Unable to open PCBOARD.DAT
Exiting to DOS!

In some setups, it is desirable to share the same PCBOARD.DAT file for 
several nodes.  A good example of this would be if you have several 
users on a network that will be logging into your nodes.  The /FILE 
parameter, enables you to specify where the PCBOARD.DAT file can be 
found for the node you are trying to load.  

After the /FILE:, you must specify where the PCBOARD.DAT.  If you 
specify an incorrect location or forget to specify the filename, you 
will see the following error message:

Unable to open PCBOARD.DAT
Exiting to DOS!

Example

PCBOARD /FILE:C:\TEMP\PCBOARD.DAT /KEY:[text to stuff]

When used in conjunction with the /LOCALON parameter, you can 
automatically send the keys specified with the /KEY parameter. This 
would allow you to setup a batch file that may automatically answer the 
graphics, name, and password questions for you -- saving you from 
entering this information each time you want to log in locally.

When specifying the keys to use on the command line, you need to be 
aware of the some special conditions:

To send a carriage return, enter ^M on the command line.  See the 
examples for this section for additional details.

If you need to send a space, you must surround the entire /KEY parameter 
in quotes to make sure that DOS treats it as one single command line 
parameter.  See the examples for this section.

If you need to send a %, you will need to enter two % characters in a 
row.  This character has a special meaning when used in batch files and 
it will be stripped unless you specify two of them together.

If you would rather send the contents of a file instead of specifying 
the keys to send on the command line, you would enter an @ followed by 
the filename you want to use after the /KEY: parameter.  By sending the 
contents of the files, you would not have to worry about the special 
conditions outlined earlier in this section.  For a sample of using the 
contents of a file, see Examples.

Examples

To automatically answer the graphics and name questions, you could 
modify your BOARD.BAT to read:

PCBOARD /LOCALON /KEY:y;q^mFirst^mLast^m

Using the previous example and stacking your name (instead of answering 
each prompt individually) would require that you use a space.  As 
mentioned previously, you will need to surround the entire /KEY 
parameter with quotes if you want to send a space.

PCBOARD /LOCALON "/KEY:y;q^mFirst Last^m"

Finally, if you want to specify that the contents of LOGIN.TXT be sent 
to the local login session, then you would modify your BOARD.BAT to 
read:

PCBOARD /LOCALON /KEY:@LOGIN.TXT

or

PCBOARD /LOCALON /KEY:@C:\LOGIN\BOB.TXT

/LOCALON

Not all users have to connect with a modem to login to PCBoard. In fact, 
the ability to let users login from remote with a modem or locally is 
one of PCBoard strong points.  You could have all of your users login 
locally from the call waiting screen using the User - Busy or User- Not 
Busy buttons but this would introduce some serious and unnecessary risks 
to your system.

Instead, you should use this command line parameter.  When this 
parameter is used, PCBoard bypasses the call-waiting screen and 
automatically performs a local login similar to selecting the User - Not 
Busy button.  The following conditions are in effect when the /LOCALON 
parameter is used:

The status line is changed to a one line status line, displaying a 
minimal amount of information.  This status line more closely resembles 
the status line that one might see in a regular modem terminal or 
communications program.

With the exception of ALT-F, ALT-I, ALT-P, ALT-T, and 5, all SysOp functions 
keys are disabled to prevent potential security risks. Descriptions of 
these function keys can be found in the While A User Is Online section 
of this chapter.

The function keys that are defined in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | 
Function Keys still remain active.

Users may upload and download files using any protocol that is internal 
to PCBoard.

For additional information about setting up local logins for multiple 
users, please refer to the Multiple Nodes chapter in this manual.

Example

PCBOARD /LOCALON

/NOENV

Normally PCBoard will create environment variables to aid the setup of 
doors in a multiple node environment.  If you do not want the PCBDAT, 
PCBDRIVE, PCBDIR, and PCBNODE environment variables to be created, use 
this parameter.

Example

PCBOARD /NOENV

/READSYS

This parameter will search the current directory for a USERS.SYS file.  
If found, the user file will be updated with the information in the 
file.  Once the update is completed, PCBoard will immediately exit to 
DOS.  This parameter is useful for third party applications that want to 
update the user file.

Example

PCBOARD /READSYS

/USERSYS;[first];[last];PWRD:[password];TPA:[application]

This command line switch is designed to be used by developers of third 
party applications.  It generates a USERS.SYS file for the user 
specified and then returns back to DOS.  The USERS.SYS file will be 
found in the directory where PCBoard was run from.  The text surrounded 
in brackets must be replaced with the following information:

      first     The user's first name for whom the USERS.SYS file will be
                generated.

      last      The user's last name for whom the USERS.SYS file will be
                generated.

      password  The user's password.  If the password is incorrect,
                the USERS.SYS file will not be generated.

   application  The name of the application that TPA information should 
                be included for. This is optional and should only be 
                used if TPA is specified.


NOTE:  The ;TPA:[application] is purely optional and should only be 
specified if the USERS.SYS file should contain the information of a 
particular TPA.

Examples

PCBOARD /USERSYS;John;Doe;PWRD:anyoldthing

PCBOARD /USERSYS;John Doe Jr.;PWRD:anyoldthing;TPA:mail

Environment Switches

Environment switches are similar to command line parameters because they 
modify the way that PCBoard behaves.  Instead of specifying the switches 
on the command line, PCBoard will look for these switches to be 
specified in the PCB environment variable.

If you look at your BOARD.BAT file, you will notice that towards the top 
is this line:

SET PCB=

It is on this line that you will specify any of the environment switches 
that are discussed in the section.  Note that the = character 
immediately follows PCB.  If it does not, PCBoard will not recognize the 
environment variable.  Specifying more than one switch can be done by 
entering them one after another on the same line as shown in this 
example:

SET PCB=/NODE:99 /COM2:

This example shows each switch separated by a space.  In reality, it is 
not necessary to sperate each switch with a space but it does make it 
clearer to read.

NOTE:  If you get an out of environment error when loading PCBoard, 
refer to your DOS manual on how to use the Shell command in your 
CONFIG.SYS file to increase the default environment size.

/BASE:[hex address]

This switch overrides the com port base address that is specified in 
PCBSetup | Modem Information | Modem Setup with the value that you use 
with this switch.  The base address under the same conditions that the 
/IRQ switch would be used.  The value that you enter for the base 
address must be in hexadecimal and may not comprise no more and no less 
than 3 digits.

Example

SET PCB=/BASE:3f8

/BAUD:[opening port speed]

This switch overrides the opening port speed that is defined in PCBSetup 
| Modem Information | Modem Setup.  In order for your modem and PCBoard 
to communicate properly, you must specify a value that your modem is 
capable of communicating at.

Example

SET PCB=/BAUD:57600

/COLOR

PCBoard attempts to automatically determine if your system is capable of 
color display or not.  Using this switch will force PCBoard to assume 
that your system is capable of color display.

Example

SET PCB=/COLOR

/COM[number]:

This switch will enable you to override the Comm Port that is defined in 
PCBSetup | Modem Information | Modem Setup.  If an invalid port number 
is specified, PCBoard will revert to the port defined in PCBSetup.

Example

SET PCB=/COM2:

/CONNECT:[carrier speed]

If you want to override the carrier speed that PCBoard uses for 
estimating how long it will take to download a file, use this switch.  
This switch is ideal if you are operating in a packet switching network 
which is capable of high speeds whereas the users accessing the system 
through the network may not be capable of the same speeds.


NOTE:  For this switch to have any effect, you must answer Y to the 
Packet-Switch Network question in PCBSetup | Modem Information | 
Configuration Switches.

Example

SET PCB=/CONNECT:2400

/IRQ:[number]

If you are using a serial port which uses a non-standard IRQ setting, 
you can use this switch to override the value defined in PCBSetup | 
Modem Information | Modem Setup.  The only time you really need to even 
worry about non-standard IRQs is when you are using COM3 and/or COM4 for 
which no world-wide standards exist.

Example

SET PCB=/IRQ:5

/MONO

PCBoard attempts to automatically determine if your system is capable of 
color display or not.  Using this switch will force PCBoard to assume 
that your system is not capable of color display.

Example

SET PCB=/MONO

/NMT

PCBoard is capable of automatically detecting when Novell's NetWare is 
running.  If you are running NetWare and you experience lockups when 
attempting to load PCBoard, you may want to use this switch.  If PCBoard 
fails to automatically detect NetWare it may think that it erroneously 
determined that a multitasker is present.  This condition would 
eventually cause your system to lockup.

Example

SET PCB=/NMT

/NODE:[node number]

This switch will override the node number that PCBoard finds in the 
PCBOARD.DAT file that it uses.  If you specify a node number which 
exceeds what you have purchased a license for, PCBoard will revert to 1 
as the node number.

Example

SET PCB=/NODE:3

/OLDINDEX

This version of PCBoard is capable of maintaining V14.x style message 
index (.NDX) files.  You may need to maintain these index files if you 
are using third party programs which access the message base index files 
but are not yet able to read the newer IDX index files.  If so, use this 
switch which will force all of your conferences to maintain the older 
style index files as well as the newer style.

Example

SET PCB=/OLDINDEX

While A User Is Online

Status Line

When a user is logged into the system, a 2-line status bar is displayed 
at the bottom of the screen.  You can refer to this status bar to 
determine information about the caller that is online.  There is far too 
much information about the user to display it all in two lines.  To 
accommodate all of the information that is displayed, there are several 
views of the status line that you can rotate between by pressing ALT-H.  
The original view is referred to as the default view.

Default View

There is a lot of information displayed on this screen.  To help explain 
the various components of this status line, it will be broken into two 
segments that will be explained in detail.


        1       Node number.  This area of the status line displays the node
                number of the screen that you are viewing.

        2       Carrier speed.  This area displays the carrier speed 
                that the caller connected to the system at.  If there is 
                an E after the carrier speed, the caller has established 
                an error-correcting session.

        3       Name of user.  This region of the status line displays 
                the full name of the user.

        4       City / location.  In this area, the contents of the City 
                field in the user's record will be displayed.
            
        5       Graphics mode indicator.  One of four indicators will be 
                displayed: N, A, G, or R.


  N - CTTY mode.  Color graphics is disabled.

  A - ANSI sequences are sent to speed up cursor positioning.

  G - ANSI sequences are sent to color the screen and to move
      the cursor.

  R - The user has selected RIPScrip mode.



        6       Last date online.  The date that the current user called the
                system is displayed in this region of the status line.

        7       Current conference.  The number between the parentheses
                displays the current conference that the user is in.

        8       Current security level.  In this area of the status 
                line, the security level of the caller is displayed.  
                This level will take into account any additional 
                security that is assigned by joining the conference or 
                other temporary security level adjustments.

        9       Call waiting screen indicators.  From the call-waiting 
                screen you can see the status of the  page bell, 
                printer, and alarm. Between the parentheses a P, A, or B 
                will be displayed if the printer, alarm, or page bell is 
                turned on.

       Times On This region of the status line displays the total number 
                of times that the user has called the system.  This 
                information can be found in each user's record too.

        Up:Dn   Refer to this area of the status line to see how many 
                files the current user has uploaded and downloaded.  The 
                number to the left of the colon is the number of files 
                that have been uploaded while the number to the right is 
                the number of files that have been downloaded.


       10       Minutes used.  In this region of the status line, the 
                total number of minutes that the user has been online is 
                displayed. This value is obtained by looking at the 
                current time and comparing it with the time that the 
                user logged in.

       11       Logon time.  The time that the caller logged into the 
                system is displayed in 24 hour format in this region.

       12       Last file handle number.  The value that is displayed in 
                the area is the last file handle number that DOS 
                returned to PCBoard You should use this number to 
                estimate the number of files that are open by this copy 
                of PCBoard.  Using this number, you will know if you 
                need to increase the number of files allocated in your 
                CONFIG.SYS file.

       13       Total free memory.  The value displayed here tells you 
                how much memory is left.  The number is displayed in 
                kilobytes (1024 bytes per kilobyte).

       14       Minutes left.  In this region, the number of minutes 
                that the user has left for this session or day is 
                displayed.  Remember that it is possible for the user to 
                achieve time credits by uploading files.

       15       Current time.  In this region, the current system time 
                is displayed in 24 hour format.


In addition to the information shown on the status line there are 
blinking characters that may appear at the bottom of the screen near the 
Logon and Current time fields.  The following describes the significance 
of the blinking characters:


        N       This node has been marked to make the SysOp the next 
                user to login.

	X	This node is set to exit to DOS after the caller disconnects.

	R	This node is set to recycle after the caller disconnects.

        S       Software flow control is turned on.  The remote caller 
                must press CTRL-Q to begin sending data again.  Unlike 
                the other indicators, this one does not flash or blink.

        p       The caller attempted to page you, but you did not answer 
                the page.

               PCBoard is scanning the USERNET.XXX file.

The second page of the status line briefly lists the SysOp function keys 
that are available while a caller is online. Refer to Keyboard Commands 
in this section for a detailed description of each.


View #3

In the upper left hand corner of this view, the user's business/data and 
home/voice phone numbers are displayed.  The two numbers are separated 
by a / character.  The following describes the rest of the fields in 
this view:

 
        E/D     Expiration date.  This field shows the expiration date 
                of the user.  If 00-00-00 is displayed, then either 
                subscription mode is not enabled, or the user has been 
                setup to not have an expiration date.

        P/W     Password.  This field displays the login password of the 
                caller.

        C1      Comment 1.  The contents of the Comment1 field in the 
                user's record is displayed in this field.

        C2      Comment 2.  The contents of the Comment2 field in the 
                user's record is displayed in this field.

To quickly display the user statistics for file transfers and messages, 
you should switch to this view.  The following information is available:


Msgs Left       Displays the total number of messages that the user has 
                entered.

Msgs Read	Displays the total number of messages read by the user.

Files U/L	Displays the number of files uploaded to the system.

Files D/L       Displays the number of files downloaded from the system.

Bytes U/L       Shows the number of bytes that the user has uploaded to 
                the system.

Bytes D/L	Shows the number of bytes that the user has downloaded.

Today           Displays the total number of bytes that have been 
                downloaded by the user today.  A negative value means 
                that the user has uploaded files and had received byte 
                credits.

This view presents information about the serial port that PCBoard uses.  
If you have defined PCBoard to use port 0, this view will not be 
available to you.  The following explains the fields in this view:

PC-Modem        The speed that is used between the computer and the 
                modem.  This is commonly referred to as the DTE speed.

Carrier         The speed that the caller connected to the system at. 
                This speed is also known as the DCE speed.

Overrun         Displays the number of overruns you have experienced. 
                This value should always be 0.  If it is not, then you 
                are receiving data faster than your current system is 
                setup to handle.

Framing         Displays the number of framing errors that have 
                occurred.  If this value is not 0, your system is having 
                problems receiving data.

Parity          Displays the number of parity errors that have occurred. 
                If this value is not 0, your system is having problems 
                receiving data.

ErrCorr         Based on the information that the modem provides to 
                PCBoard at login, this field will show whether or not an 
                error-correcting session has been detected.

InBuf           The total number of bytes that are currently in the 
                input buffer.  This value should normally be 0.

OutBuf          Displays the total number of bytes in the output buffer. 
                This value you should normally be 0.

CTS             Shows the status of the CTS signal on the serial port.  
                The signal will either be up or dn.

In addition to the rest of the fields in this view, PCBoard will display 
the type of UART that it detects in the lower right hand corner of the 
status line.  The possible value are:

8250 OLD	An older 8250 UART has been detected.

8250A/16450	An 8250A or 16450 UART has been detected.

16550           An older 16550 UART chip has been detected.  This chip 
                has a bug which prevents the 16 byte buffer from working 
                correctly.

16550 FIFO      An older 16550 UART chip has been detected.  PCBoard 
                determined that this chip is capable of using the 16 
                byte buffer.

16550A FIFO     A 16550A UART chip has been detected.  PCBoard will take 
                advantage of the 16 byte buffer of this UART chip.

COMM-DRV        PCBoard is communicating with the modem using the 
                multiport driver.

FOSSIL          PCBoard is communicating with the modem using a FOSSIL
                driver.

Keyboard Commands

This section details the keyboard commands that are available to you 
while a user is online.  You may only use these from the local keyboard 
-- not while you are logged in from remote. 


        F1      SysOp privileges.  Use this keyboard command to 
                temporarily upgrade a user from a non-SysOp security 
                level to the SysOp security level defined in PCBSetup | 
                Security Levels | Sysop Commands.  To return the caller 
                to their original security level during the same call, 
                press 1 again.  Once the caller logs off, their security 
                level will be returned to the original value.

        F2      Lock out.  This keyboard command will allow you to 
                automatically lock out the current users from the 
                system.  If you choose to lock the caller out, their 
                security level will be dropped to 0, and they will be 
                immediately disconnected from the system.

        F3      Toggle printing caller log.  Use of this keyboard 
                command will toggle the printer status.  Anything that 
                is written to the caller log will also be written to the 
                printer port defined in PCBSetup | Node Configuration.  
                You will know that the printer status is on when a P is 
                printed in the parentheses found on the lower right-hand 
                corner of the status line.

        F4      Toggle page bell status.  Use of this keyboard command 
                will toggle the page bell status.  When the page bell is 
                turned on, users will be able to page you for chatting 
                if they attempt to page between the hours defined in 
                PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Limits.  If paged, 
                you will be beeped for 30 seconds. You can then choose 
                to answer the page by pressing M or to ignore the page.  
                If you do not answer, the user will be asked if they 
                wish to leave a comment to the SysOp.  You will know 
                that the page bell status is on when a B is printed in 
                the parentheses found on the lower right-hand corner of 
                the status line.

        F5      Shell to DOS.  As long as you have not disabled local 
                shells to DOS in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | 
                System Control, this keyboard command will cause PCBoard 
                to shell to DOS.

        F6      Modify current user's record.  Essentially, this 
                keyboard command will enable you to edit the same fields 
                that you can edit by using the C subcommand of the 7 
                SysOp command.  The difference being that the current 
                user's record will be edited instead of you making an 
                attempt to find the proper record.  If the user does not 
                have a record on disk yet, this keyboard command is 
                disabled.

        F7      Toggle alarm status.  Use of this keyboard command will 
                toggle the alarm status.  While a caller is online 
                (either local or via modem), PCBoard will beep when an 
                invalid command is entered, at the beginning of the 
                call, and when the automatic logoff for inactivity is 
                about to occur.  The setting of the alarm will determine 
                if the beeps will be heard on the local computer.  You 
                will know that the page bell status is on when an A is 
                printed in the parentheses found on the lower right-hand 
                corner of the status line.

        F8      Disconnect current caller.  To force a user to 
                immediately disconnect from the system you may use this 
                keyboard command. Before the caller is disconnected, you 
                are asked to confirm that you do indeed want to 
                disconnect the caller.

        F9      Toggle screen display.  This keyboard command will 
                toggle the status of the screen.  When the screen is 
                off, no information is printed on the screen (leaving 
                the entire screen black). Otherwise, the normal 
                information you would see is displayed on the screen.

        F10     Chat with caller.  To break into chat with the caller, 
                use this keyboard command.  When in chat mode, both you 
                and the user can type interactively with one another.  
                When you finished chatting with the user, press E to 
                return to PCBoard.

        ALT-B   Send a bell to the caller.  When this keyboard command 
                is used, a beep will be sent to the remote caller.  This 
                beep is useful for attempting to get their attention.  
                For you to hear this beep locally, the alarm status must 
                be on.

        ALY-D   Run PCBFiler.  PCBoard shells  to DOS and runs PCBFiler. 
                If a caller is online, they will be informed that you 
                have exited to DOS and that they should remain online.

        ALT-F   Capture text to a file.  Use this keyboard command to 
                capture the text that PCBoard displays on the screen to 
                a file on disk.  When you turn on capture mode, you will 
                be prompted to enter the filename you wish to capture 
                the information to.  To turn off capturing, press ALT-F 
                again.

        ALT-I   Import text from a file.  This keyboard command can be 
                used to import a text file directly into PCBoard's 
                buffer.  If PCBoard finds the filename that you specify, 
                the contents of that file will be used as if you typed 
                in the information at the keyboard.

        ALT-M   Run PCBMoni.  PCBoard will shell to DOS and execute PCBMoni.

        ALT-N   Reserve node for the SysOp.  After the caller 
                disconnects, PCBoard will automatically select the Sysop 
                - Busy button from the call waiting screen rather than 
                wait for the next call to come in.

        ALT-P   Capture text to the printer.  Use this keyboard command 
                to capture the text that PCBoard displays on the screen 
                to the printer defined in PCBSetup | Node Configuration.  
                When you turn on capture mode, a P will appear next to 
                the last file number opened on the status line.  To turn 
                off capturing, press ALT-P again.

        ALT-R   Recycle the node.  This command will mark the current 
                node to be recycled after the caller disconnects.  For 
                additional information on recycling a node, refer to the 
                15 SysOp command in the PCBoard Commands chapter of this 
                manual.

        ALT-S   Run System Manager.  System Manager is executed by 
                shelling to DOS.

        ALT-T   Send a top of form to printer.  This keyboard command 
                sends a form feed to the printer defined in PCBSetup | 
                Node Configuration.

        ALT-X   Drop to DOS after current call.  This keyboard command 
                will automatically select the DOS - Busy button after 
                the current caller is disconnected.  The phone will be 
                busy, and PCBoard will exit.

        ALT-F1  Decrease available time.  When this keyboard command is 
                used, the caller's available time online will be 
                reduced.  If the user's available time is under 10 
                minutes, it will be decreased by one minute. Otherwise, 
                their time will be decreased by 5 minutes.

        ALT-F2  Increase available time.  When this keyboard command is 
                used, the caller's available time online will be 
                increased.  If the user's available time is under 10 
                minutes, it will be increased by one minute.  Otherwise, 
                their time will be increased by 5 minutes.

        ALT-F9  Decrease security level.  Using this keyboard command 
                will reduce the caller's current security level.  The 
                new security level will be the next lowest entry in the 
                PWRD file (PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration 
                Files).  Once the security level has been adjusted, the 
                user will adopt the characteristics of the new security 
                level (including the time and bytes available).

        ALT-F10 Increase security level.    Using this keyboard command 
                will increase the caller's current security level.  The 
                new security level will be the next entry in the PWRD 
                file (PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration Files).  
                Once the security level has been adjusted, the user will 
                adopt the characteristics of the new security level 
                (including the time and bytes available).

Local Logins

Anytime you access the system locally rather than through a serial 
device, you are performing a local login.  All information is displayed 
to you on your local machine and you are actually running PCBoard on 
your machine.  There are several methods you can use to log into the 
system in local mode.

Methods To Login Locally

Perhaps the most frequently used method of logging into the system 
locally is via the call-waiting screen.  On the call-waiting screen, you 
will notice the following four buttons:

The two buttons on the left will log you into the system asking you for 
your name, etc.  In essence, this is identical to accessing the system 
via modem or serial port except everything is on your local screen.  If 
you use the two buttons on the right, then you will be logged into the 
system as the SysOp (as defined in record #1 of the users file).

You may also use the /LOCALON command line parameter of PCBOARD.EXE.  If 
you use this parameter on the command line, then the call-waiting screen 
will be bypassed and the user will be immediately logged into the 
system.  This method would be identical to selecting User - Not Busy 
from the call-waiting screen.

For example, if you wanted a node to be configured to bypass the local 
login screen and immediately login, you could modify your PCBOARD line 
in your BOARD.BAT file to read:

PCBOARD /LOCALON

Differences in Operation

Normally everything behaves/displays the same whether you are logged in 
locally or over a serial connection.  However, when you are logged in 
locally, there are a few items that you may want to be aware of:

Perhaps the most noticeable difference between remote logins and local 
logins is when you transfer files.  PCBoard behaves differently when you 
are logged in locally.  Refer to the File Transfers section in the 
SysOp's Guide chapter of this manual for additional details..

When a user is logged in locally, the COM port is defined as 0 in the 
setup.  This means that if you have any door or utility applications 
that reference PCBoard to see what COM port is being used, be sure that 
they are able to discern that COM 0 means that the user is on locally.

The speed of a caller when they are online is set to what you have 
defined as the Opening Baud Rate in PCBSetup | Modem Information | Modem 
Setup.

Additional Features

While a user is logged in locally some additional keystrokes are 
available.  They are as follows:

Scrl-Lck        Scroll-back Buffer.  Access text that has scrolled off 
                of the screen.  The number of lines that are stored in 
                the scroll-back buffer is defined in PCBSetup | 
                Configuration Options | Limits.

F5              Shell to DOS.  Enables you to shell to a DOS prompt 
                while in PCBoard.  You can disable or enable this option 
                in PCBSetup | Configuration Options | System Control 
                with the Allow Local SHELL to DOS.

ALT-I           Import a text file.  You may need to import or stuff a 
                text file while in PCBoard.  Perhaps you need to include 
                a file into a message.  While entering the message you 
                can press ALT-I.  You will then be asked for the filename 
                to import.  If the file is not found, nothing will be 
                done.  If the file is found, the text will be imported 
                into PCBoard just as if you had typed the information.

ALT-F           Capture screen output to file.  If you would like to 
                capture the text that PCBoard displays on your screen, 
                you can press ALT-F.  If you do not already have a capture 
                file open, then you will be asked for the filename you 
                wish to capture to.  If you do have a capture file open, 
                then pressing ALT-F will close the capture file.  You will 
                know if a capture file is open because you will see an F 
                on the status line.

ALT-P           Capture screen output to printer.  Capturing text to the 
                printer is almost identical to capturing text to a file 
                however, you are never asked or a filename.  PCBoard 
                looks at the printer port you defined in PCBSetup | Node 
                Information.  All information that PCBoard displays 
                (with the exception of More prompts and such) will be 
                sent to the printer.  Like capturing to a file, you will 
                see a P on the status line to signify that you are 
                capturing output to the printer.

ALT-T           Send a form feed to the printer.  If you need to send a 
                form feed to the printer, you may do so by pressing ALT-T.

BOARD.BAT

For PCBoard to function normally, you need to use BOARD.BAT to load each 
node on your system.  This batch file provides the logic that allows 
PCBoard to exit out of memory, load a door application or event, and 
return where the caller left off from.

Sample

The BOARD.BAT that came with your copy of PCBOARD probably resembles 
this example:

@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set PCB=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb
pcboard
if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist event.bat event
if exist endpcb goto end
board
:end

Detailed Explanation

To help better understand the flow and structure of the BOARD.BAT file, 
this section breaks it down into three sections. Each section shows a 
portion of the batch file and proceeds to explain each line in detail.

Preparing To Executing PCBoard

@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set PCB=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb


This DOS batch file command will prevent each line from displaying on 
screen as it is executed.

Changes to the C: drive.

Changes to the PCB subdirectory.

Defines the PCB environment variable.  If you want to use any of 
PCBoard's environment switches you must add them to this line.

Defines the DSZLOG environment variable.  Several external protocols 
will read this environment variable to determine where to log the files 
that are transferred.  Considering that PCBoard also reads this 
environment variable on external batch transfer protocols it is very 
important to have this variable properly defined.

Checks the current directory to see if REMOTE.BAT exists.  If it does, 
delete it to prevent it from accidentally being executed by another 
caller.  This file is created by PCBoard from your REMOTE.SYS file.  
Because the REMOTE.SYS file remains on disk, this file can be deleted.

Checks the current directory to see if DOOR.BAT exists.  If it does, 
delete it to prevent another caller from executing it. PCBoard creates 
the DOOR.BAT file from your batch file for your doors.  This file is 
used as a temporary file so that DOS can execute your door application.

When PCBoard exits, it creates an ENDPCB file in the current directory.  
This file does not contain any useful information. Instead, it is used 
later in your BOARD.BAT to determine if PCBoard should reload, or jump 
to the end label.

Executing PCBoard


pcboard

This line serves one purpose -- to load PCBoard.  If you want to use any 
of PCBoard's command line parameters, you need to specify them on this 
line.

After PCBoard Exits


if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist event.bat event
if exist endpcb goto end
board
:end

Checks the current subdirectory to see if a file called REMOTE.BAT 
exists.  If it does, execute it.  It is the responsibility of this batch 
file to reload BOARD.BAT when finished.

Checks the current subdirectory to see if a file called DOOR.BAT exists.  
If it does, execute it.  It is the responsibility of this batch file to 
reload BOARD.BAT when finished.

Checks the current subdirectory to see if a file called EVENT.BAT 
exists.  If it does, execute it.  It is the responsibility of this batch 
file to reload BOARD.BAT when finished.

Checks the current subdirectory for a file called ENDPCB.  If this file 
exists, goto the end label in the batch file which returns to DOS.

This line is a catch-all that will reload PCBoard if no ENDPCB file is 
found (which should always exist when PCBoard exits).

Defines a batch label called end.

Errorlevels

When PCBoard exits to DOS, it will set an errorlevel based on why it 
exited to DOS.  Using DOS batch commands, you may check the errorlevel 
that is returned from the program that was last run and take appropriate 
actions.

Checking An Errorlevel

To test an errorlevel you need to use the IF batch file command. If you 
were to insert the following line somewhere after the PCBOARD line in 
your BOARD.BAT


IF ERRORLEVEL 0 ECHO No Errors


the message No Errors will be printed to the screen if PCBoard exits 
with an errorlevel of 0.  For additional information on checking 
errorlevels, refer to your DOS manual.

NOTE: Due to the way DOS errorlevels, you should check for higher 
numbered errorlevels first before checking lower errorlevels.  PCBoard 
may exit with an errorlevel HIGHER than 7, yet DOS will treat an IF 
ERRORLEVEL 7 as being true.  Therefore, if you will be using FAX 
software you should probably write your batch file like this:


      pcboard
      if errorlevel 8 board    <-- test for all higher levels
      if errorlevel 7 fax      <-- if 7 is still found, run fax
      ... etc

Errorlevel 0

This errrorlevel will be returned anytime that PCBoard exits to DOS and 
expects no other action to take place.  The only time that this will 
really occur is by selecting DOS - Busy or DOS - Not Busy from the call 
waiting screen.

Errorlevel 1

This errorlevel will be returned if PCBoard is exiting to run an event.  
At this point, the door batch file has been copied to EVENT.BAT in the 
current directory.  The BOARD.BAT that is included with you package uses 
an if exist event.bat line to determine when the event should be run 
instead of testing the errorlevel.

Errorlevel 2

This errorlevel will be returned if PCBoard is exiting to run a door.  
At this point, the event file has been copied to DOOR.BAT in the current 
directory.  The BOARD.BAT that is included with you package uses an if 
exist door.bat line to determine when a door  should be run instead of 
testing the errorlevel.

Errorlevel 3

This errorlevel will be returned if PCBoard is exiting to run a door.  
At this point, the REMOTE.SYS file has been copied to REMOTE.BAT in the 
current directory.  The BOARD.BAT that is included with you package uses 
an if exist remote.bat line to determine when REMOTE.BAT should be run 
instead of testing the errorlevel.

Errorlevel 4

This errorlevel is no longer used by PCBoard.

Errorlevel 5

If you have answered Y to the Exit to DOS After Each Call option in 
PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Switches, PCBoard will exit with this 
errorlevel after each disconnect.  By adding a line to your BOARD.BAT 
that tests for this errorlevel, you can determine the difference between 
a caller disconnecting and exiting via DOS - Busy or DOS - Not busy on 
the call waiting screen.

The following BOARD.BAT shows an example of what your BOARD.BAT might 
look like after you have added the ability to test for errorlevel 5:


@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set PCB=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb
pcboard
if errorlevel 99 board
if errorlevel 5 loggedof.bat
if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist event.bat event
if exist endpcb goto end
board
:end

Two lines have been added in this example.  The first line checks for 
critical errors while the second checks to see if the caller 
disconnected.  If the caller has disconnected, a batch file called 
LOGGEDOF.BAT will be executed.

Errorlevel 6

If PCBoard is exiting because the node was marked to be recycled, this 
errorlevel will be returned.  In your BOARD.BAT, you can add a statement 
which checks to see if the node is recycling.  If so, run a batch file 
which does some special processing.  The following illustrates the 
change that would need to be made to BOARD.BAT:


@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set PCB=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb
pcboard
if errorlevel 99 board
if errorlevel 6 call c:\update.bat
if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist event.bat event
if exist endpcb goto end
board
:end


The two lines that were added to the batch file are highlighted in bold.  
The first line checks to see if the errorlevel returned by PCBoard is 
99.  If so, a critical error has occurred and this line will cause 
BOARD.BAT to be run again.  If a critical error did not occur, the 
second line will run UPDATE.BAT found in the root directory of drive C.  
Notice that the call batch command is used.  This will make sure that 
control is returned back to PCBoard after the UPDATE.BAT runs. For more 
information on the call command, refer to your DOS manual.

Errorlevel 7

If PCBoard answers the call and the modem returns FAX or +FCON instead 
of CONNECT or CARRIER, PCBoard will immediately exit with an errorlevel 
of 7.  A simple check for this errorlevel in your BOARD.BAT will tell 
you if you need to load your fax software of not.  A modified BOARD.BAT 
may resemble the following:


@echo off
c:
cd\pcb
set PCB=
set dszlog=pcbdsz.log
if exist remote.bat rename remote.bat remote.sys
if exist door.bat del door.bat
if exist endpcb del endpcb
pcboard
if errorlevel 99 board
if errorlevel 7 c:\fax\recvfax [params]
if exist remote.bat remote
if exist door.bat door
if exist event.bat event
if exist endpcb goto end
board

:end


Notice that two lines were added to the batch file.  The first checks to 
see if PCBoard exited due to an errorlevel of 99 while the second checks 
to see if a FAX call has been detected.  You should be aware that the 
fax connection has already been established.  You should use a program 
to receive the fax that assumes the connection has already been made.  
Refer to your modem manual to see if such a utility was shipped with 
your modem.

NOTE:  Modems which require TSR software to be loaded ahead of PCBoard, 
and which do not let PCBoard control the answering of the call, are a 
risk to PCBoard's security and are not supported.  In addition, modems 
that do not issue a FAX or +FCON message are not currently supported.

Errorlevel 99

If PCBoard is unable to load because a critical error has been detected, 
it will exit with this errorlevel.  For a list of messages that will be 
printed by PCBoard if it is unable to load, refer to the Trouble 
Shooting section of this chapter. Each message is thoroughly explained.

Troubleshooting

PCBoard Will Not Load - Gives Error Message

If PCBoard is unable to safely load, you will receive an error message 
in the upper left portion of your screen.  This error message gives you 
information about why PCBoard could not load. The following lists each 
possible error that can occur as PCBoard loads and an explanation of how 
to fix the problem.

ALL NODES ARE BUSY AT THIS TIME PLEASE TRY LATER

In order for you to see this message, then you must have set the Float 
Node Number option in PCBSetup | Node Configuration to Y.

A user has attempted to log into the system but there is not a free node 
on the system for them to log into.  Remember that PCBoard will only 
begin scanning for free nodes from the node number that is specified in 
PCBSetup | Node Configuration up to your software license limit.  In 
order to check if a node is free, the USERNET.XXX file is scanned.

The only cure for this problem is to free up a node for new users to 
login or to upgrade your software license limit.

If you check your system and you see that PCBoard thinks people are 
logged in locally when in reality you know that they are not (because 
they rebooted their system from the local connection or otherwise 
improperly exited PCBoard), you need to manually clear out their entries 
using PCBMONI.EXE.

Load PCBMONI and cursor down to the node number.  Next, press the M bar 
to access the Edit User Net Status screen.  In the status field, enter Z 
for Node is offline.  This will clear the entry for that node.  The node 
will then be free for other users to log in to the system.

Can't create caller log:

PCBoard attempted to open the caller log.  The log file could not be 
opened, so an attempt was made to create the file. However, the file 
could not be created.  Since there is no way for to keep track of the 
calls to the system, the system is not brought online.

The following are all valid reasons as to why the caller log could not 
be opened/created:

The path specified in PCBSetup | File Locations | System Files does not 
exist.  Since the path does not exist, PCBoard cannot create the caller 
log file.

If your system is on a network, you may have lost your connection to the 
server which contains the caller log files.  This would mean that the 
path where your files are normally stored would not exist and 
consequently the log could not be created.

You do not have enough file handles to open up the caller log. Make sure 
that you have at least 25 files defined in your CONFIG.SYS (FILES=25) 
for each node that the machine runs.  In addition, also make sure that 
your server (if you are running on a network) has at least 25 file 
handles for each node that you are running.

Cannot open system PCBTEXT file

PCBoard attempted to open the default PCBTEXT file defined in PCBSetup | 
File Locations | System Files but could not open the file.  This may 
mean that you have an invalid path specified in the PCBTEXT field or the 
path is correct, but there is no PCBTEXT file in the directory.  It 
could also mean that you do not have enough file handles available.  
Make sure that each node on the computer has at least 25 file handles 
available via CONFIG.SYS and that your server also has at least 25 file 
handles for each node that you are running.

Error initializing comm port

You should only see this message if you are using the /M version of 
PCBoard.  It means that the  communications port specified in PCBSetup | 
Modem Information | Modem Setup could not be opened via COMMDRV.  A 
number will be displayed after the error message.  To get more 
information why the port could not be opened, call technical support and 
give the technician the error message and error number.

Error obtaining FOSSIL information

Only the /M version of PCBoard will report this error and only if you 
have configured PCBoard to communicate through the FOSSIL driver 
(PCBSetup | Modem Information | Modem Setup).  PCBoard has attempted to 
communicate via a FOSSIL driver.  However, the information that was 
returned from the FOSSIL driver was invalid.  Make sure that your FOSSIL 
driver is installed properly.

ERROR!  Need to update User Info File Conference Allocations

Anytime that you increase the Number of Highest Conference Desired in 
PCBSetup | Configuration Options | Messages, you need to update your 
conference allocations.  To do this, you need to load System Manager, 
select User Info File Maintenance, and finally select Change Conference 
Allocation. 

You will be shown some information about your USERS.INF file. If you do 
need to upgrade the file to accommodate the increased number of 
conferences you are told that the file needs to be updated and then are 
asked if you wish to update the file.  By updating the USERS.INF file,. 
the size of the file on disk will be increased so that information about 
the new conferences can be stored.

ERROR!  PCBML.DAT does not contain a default (blank extension)
entry.

PCBoard uses the language that is defined without a filename extension 
(usually the default language) to determine the text that should be 
written to the caller log files.  If a language is defined without an 
extension, PCBoard cannot determine the text that should be written to 
the log files.

If you receive this error, you need to modify your PCBML.DAT file 
(PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration Files) to include a language 
that has a blank extension.  You may have to change the definition of 
one of the currently defined languages or you may have to install a 
brand new language to meet this requirement.  Until the requirement is 
met, PCBoard will not load.

ERROR!  System is setup for SHARE access...

If you have answered Y to the Running a Network / Multitasker System in 
PCBSetup | Node Configuration PCBoard checks to make sure that SHARE is 
loaded and functioning properly before accepting calls.

If you receive this error message, SHARE.EXE is either not loaded or is 
not functioning properly.  Without SHARE, file access cannot be 
relegated properly leading to potential corruption of files.  Rather 
than risk data corruption, PCBoard will display this error message and 
return to the DOS prompt.


Check your configuration to make sure that SHARE.EXE is being
loaded in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Error!  USERNET.XXX filename is blank.

In order for PCBoard to be able to operate properly in a multinode 
configuration it must be able to read and write to the USERNET.XXX file.  
If you get this error, the location of this file is blank in PCBSetup | 
File Locations | System Files. Specify a valid path and filename and the 
error should not reoccur.

HEADER ERROR IN USERS.INF - OR UNABLE TO READ USERS.INF FILE

The USERS.INF file has been damaged or corrupted in some manner. This 
may signify a possible file corruption problem on your system (e.g., 
faulty disk cache, etc.) or a utility may that accesses the USERS.INF 
file may have damaged the file in some fashion.

About the only thing that you can do (as an immediate fix) is to 
recreate the USERS.INF file by selecting Create User Info File from 
System Manager | User Info File Maintenance.

insufficient memory for comm buffers

PCBoard determined that you did not have enough memory to create the 
buffers that it uses for communication buffers.  You need to increase 
the amount of conventional memory that is available before you load 
PCBoard.

insufficient memory for conference strings

You do not have enough conventional memory available for PCBoard to 
store the conference strings.  You need to increase the amount of 
conventional memory that is available before you load PCBoard.

insufficient memory for conference flags

There is not enough conventional memory for PCBoard to store the 
conference flags.  Before PCBoard can be loaded, you need to increase 
the amount of conventional memory that is available before you load 
PCBoard.

insufficient memory for message pointers

PCBoard determined that you did not have enough conventional memory 
available to store the message pointers.  Before you can load PCBoard, 
you must increase the amount of conventional memory that is available.

Invalid comm port - COMMDRV access not found

PCBoard attempted to open the communications port specified in PCBSetup 
| Modem Information | Modem Setup but determined that you do not have 
COMMTSR loaded.  In order for the /M version of PCBoard to run properly, 
you must have COMMTSR loaded as per the installation instructions in the 
Multiple Nodes chapter of this manual..

Along with the error message, you will be given an error number. When 
you call for technical support, please have the error number handy so 
that the technician will be able to help you solve your problem faster.

Invalid comm port - FOSSIL driver not found

You have specified that PCBoard should communicate via the FOSSIL driver 
that you have installed.  However, the FOSSIL driver could not be 
identified.  Make sure that your driver is installed properly.

Invalid comm port or UART not functioning

The COM port that you have specified in PCBSetup | Modem Information | 
Modem Setup does not exist, or the UART for the COM port is 
malfunctioning.  Check the hardware for your COM port to make sure that 
it is functioning properly and replace it if necessary.

Invalid use of /C: switch

You have used the /C: command line switch with PCBOARD.EXE but you have 
not specified a valid port/connect speed for the option.  Make sure that 
your use a valid port speed such as /C:19200, /C:14400, etc.

Output buffer must be configured for at least 2048 bytes

This error only occurs when using the /M version of PCBoard.  In
the DAT file that is used to load COMMTSR, there is a setting
for the output buffer size.  PCBoard determined that the size of
the output buffer was less than 2K.  Re-run DRVSETUP.EXE to make
sure that the settings are correct and save a new DAT file.

PCBoard is already loaded!  Type 'EXIT' to return

You have attempted to load PCBoard, but is already loaded.  This is 
usually caused when you press 5 to shell out to DOS and then execute 
BOARD.BAT while you are in the shell.  To return to PCBoard, type EXIT 
at the DOS prompt.

PCBTEXT is unavailable

PCBoard attempted to open the PCBTEXT file but determined that it could 
not be opened.  This could be due to any of the following reasons:

The path you specified in PCBSetup | File Locations | System Files is 
invalid or does not exist.  Therefore, the PCBTEXT file(s) could not 
exist in that directory let alone be opened for access.

If you are running in a network configuration, you may have lost your 
connection to the server thereby making the files on the server 
unavailable for access.  Reconnect to the server (if your PCBTEXT 
file(s) are stored on the server) and the problem will be corrected.

You may not have enough file handles available to open another file.  
Make sure that you have allocated enough file handles in your CONFIG.SYS 
statement.  For one node on the machine you should have FILES=25.  If 
you are running 3 nodes on the one machine then you need to have at 
least FILES=75.  If you are in a network configuration, make sure that 
you have allocated at least 25 file handles for each node.

PCBTEXT is the wrong version!  Run MKPCBTXT to convert it.

The default PCBTEXT file that PCBoard loads at startup was determined to 
be the wrong version.  To fix the file, load MKPCBTXT.EXE.  When 
prompted for the filename to edit, specify the full path and filename of 
your PCBTEXT file.  You will then be guided on the steps necessary to 
fix the file.

PCBTEXT needs to be upgraded!  Run MKPCBTXT.

Your default PCBTEXT file is an older version which was not designed to 
run with the version of PCBOARD.EXE that you are running.  If you run 
MKPCBTXT.EXE and specify the filename of your default PCBTEXT file, it 
will be upgraded.

Unable to open PCBPROT.DAT file

PCBoard attempted to open the PCBPROT.DAT file but could not locate it, 
or it could not be opened.  The following are some reasons why the file 
could not be opened:

The file  you specified in PCBSetup | File Locations | Configuration 
Files is invalid or does not exist.

If you are running in a network configuration, you may have lost your 
connection to the server thereby making the files on the server 
unavailable for access.  Reconnect to the server (if your PCBPROT.DAT 
file is stored on the server) and the problem will be corrected.

You may not have enough file handles available to open another file.  
Make sure that you have allocated enough file handles in your CONFIG.SYS 
statement.  For one node on the machine you should have FILES=25.  If 
you are running 3 nodes on the one machine then you need to have at 
least FILES=75.  If you are in a network configuration, make sure that 
you have allocated at least 25 file handles for each node.

UNABLE TO OPEN USERS FILE - RUN PCBSM TO CREATE IT

PCBoard attempted to load the USER file but could not do so. The file 
may not exist or the location specified in PCBSetup | File Locations | 
System Files is incorrect.  Other possibilities include not having 
enough file handles specified in CONFIG.SYS to open the file or having 
lost your connection to the server (if running a network) where the 
USERS file exists.

If you do not have a USERS file and need to create it then you should 
use System Manager to create a new USERS file.  If you have a USERS.INF 
file but no USERS file, then delete the USERS.INF file that remains 
behind.

Next, load System Manager, and select Users File Maintenance and then 
select Edit Users File.  You will be informed of an error and that you 
need to create the User Info File this is to be expected.  Next, return 
to the Main Menu and select Users Info File Maintenance and select 
Create User Info File.  You will be asked if you wish to create the 
file.  Answer Y to the question and a new USERS.INF file will be 
created.  You should now have one record in the USERS file which is the 
SysOp record.

UNABLE TO OPEN USERS.INF - RUN PCBSM TO CREATE IT

The USERS.INF file could not be opened.  If you know that you have a 
USERS.INF file then this error could be caused by any of the following 
reasons:

The location of the USERS.INF file specified in PCBSetup | File 
Locations | System Files is incorrect or invalid.  Specify the correct 
location of the USERS.INF file or make sure that the entry is valid.

If you are using a network then make sure that you have not lost your 
connection to the server.  If you have lost your connection then of 
course you will not be able to access the USERS.INF file that is stored 
there.

Make sure that you have enough file handles available.  You should 
allocate at least 25 file handles for each node on the computer and on 
your server you should allocate 25 handles for each node on your system.  
This can be done using the FILES= statement in your CONFIG.SYS.

If you need to create a new USERS.INF file then you may do so by loading 
System Manager, selecting User Info File Maintenance, followed by Create 
User Info File.

USERNET.XXX: create error

PCBoard attempted to create the USERNET.XXX file used to maintain what 
each user is doing on the system but was unable to.  The file location 
in PCBSetup | File Locations | System Files may point to an invalid 
subdirectory or if you are running under a network you may have lost 
your connection to the server.

Another possibility is that you may not have enough file handles 
available to open the file.  Make sure that each session on your 
computer has 20 file handles available and that your server has 20 file 
handles allocated for each node in the system.

USERNET.XXX: format error

PCBoard has determined that the format of the USERNET.XXX file is 
invalid.  It could be that you are using an older version of the 
USERNET.XXX or it has been corrupted excessively.  If you delete the 
file, PCBoard will recreate the file using the proper format.

USERNET.XXX: memory error

When PCBoard attempted to load the USERNET.XXX file into memory there 
was not enough conventional memory to do so.  You need to increase the 
amount of conventional memory that is available before you load PCBoard.

USERNET.XXX: open error

The USERNET.XXX file could not be opened.  It could be that the path to 
your USERNET.XXX file is incorrect (PCBSetup | File Locations | System 
Files).  Another possibility is that you have lost connection to the 
server or you may have insufficient file handles available to open the 
file.

USERNET.XXX: read error

When PCBoard attempted to read the USERNET.XXX file it could not do so 
or encountered an error of some sort.  If you have had disk access 
problems in the past it may cause this type of error.  You could delete 
the USERNET.XXX file since PCBoard will recreate it and see if that 
clears anything up.  However, it may turn out that this is a symptom of 
hardware failure on your system.

PCBoard Does Not Answer

Nothing can be more frustrating than setting up your system and then 
realizing that it is not accepting any calls.  This sections details 
some reasons why your system may not be properly answering phone calls.  

Phone Rings But PCBoard Does Not Recognize The Call

Normally when a call comes in, PCBoard will display Ring
Detected followed by a number which counts down.  When you see this 
message you know that a call was detected and that the two modems are 
attempting to establish a connection.  What if you do not see this 
message but you know a phone call is coming in? There are two common 
reasons why this may occur:

Your modem is not properly configured to send RING whenever a call is 
detected by the modem.  Without the modem returning that response code, 
PCBoard does not know if the phone is ringing or not.  Make sure you 
used PCBModem to configure you modem.  It will setup both your hardware 
and your software to work as PCBoard expects it to work.

You have purchased the /M version of PCBoard but you are running the 
regular version of PCBoard.  The /M version stores the configuration in 
PCBOARD.DAT as PORTx whereas the normal software stores it as COMx. 
Because the normal version of PCBoard does not know how to handle the 
PORTx, it will report No Modem Selected as the communications port.  Of 
course, since no communications port is selected, PCBoard cannot answer 
the phone.

PCBoard Recognizes Call, Counts Down to 0 And Recycles

When a call is detected, PCBoard counts down from the value you entered 
in Seconds to wait for carrier located in PCBSetup | Modem Information | 
Modem Setup.  As soon as you see the Ring Detected message, PCBoard 
sends an ATA to the modem signaling that it should answer the call.  At 
this point, it is up to your modem to answer the call properly.

If your countdown goes to 0 for every phone call without getting a 
connection established then it could be caused by the following reasons:

You have not given the modem enough time to answer the phone. Increase 
the Seconds to wait for carrier so that your modem has enough time to 
answer the call.

If your RS-232 cable is not wired correctly then the PCBoard may never 
realize that the connection has been established.  In order for a 
connection to be realized as valid, PCBoard waits for the CONNECT 
message from the modem and also checks the CD (carrier detect) line to 
make sure that connection really exists.  If your CD line is not wired 
properly (or not wired at all) in your RS-232 cable then the connection 
may never be considered valid.  The easiest solution to this problem is 
to make sure that your cable has all 25 pins wired straight through.

Modem Reset Errors

Anytime PCBoard cannot send the initialization string at the 
call-waiting screen you will receive a Modem Reset Error which is 
signified by a low-tone beep and a message.  Before ever sending the 
initialization string though, an AT is sent to the modem.  PCBoard then 
expects an OK to be returned from the modem.  If that OK is not received 
within approximately 25 seconds then PCBoard will report that there was 
a modem reset error.

Error Occurs When You Load PCBoard

If the error occurs when you load PCBoard for the first time, this 
usually signifies that your hardware and software are not configured 
properly.  First, make sure  the right communications port is being 
opened.  If that all checks out, then it may mean that you have an IRQ 
conflict in your system which will prohibit communications with the 
devices that are using the same IRQ.

Another possibility is that your initialization string contains a 
command which is not recognized by your modem.  Check your 
initialization string in PCBSetup to make sure that all commands in your 
initialization string are valid.

Error Occurs When Recycling After A Call

If you get modem reset errors after users have logged into your system, 
it could be caused by any of the following reasons:

You have loaded another application which access the same COM port as 
the node that is giving you the errors.  You may have also accessed a 
port which uses the same IRQ.  That would mean the other application 
stole away the IRQ -- meaning  PCBoard would not be able to communicate 
with the modem.

Your modem may be malfunctioning.  It is not uncommon for modems to 
malfunction.  One solution may be to turn your modem off and back on 
again to see if that has any effect on the situation. Aside from that, 
there is not much you can do but to have your modem checked.

Date Not Changing

A common question among SysOps is why did my date not change at midnight 
the night before?  You may be inclined to blame PCBoard for not changing 
the date, but in reality PCBoard has nothing to do with changing the 
date at midnight.

The responsibility of changing the system date lies with the the 
software that reads the BIOS clock ticks.  PCBoard does not read the 
BIOS clock ticks, therefore it is not responsible for changing the date.  
It is quite common for some TSRs to monitor time in this fashion and to 
not properly update the date. Therefore, you may want to begin by 
systematically removing the TSRs on your system to see if any of them 
may be the cause of the problem.

Because something else is reading the BIOS clock ticks the CPU may be 
too busy to change the system date.  That is the real reason your system 
date is not changing at midnight.

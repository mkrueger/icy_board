 Menu Description (MNU) File Format
 ----------------------------------

 A PCBoard MNU file describes a SysOp defined menu that can be used for
 many purposes.  It is a flat ASCII text file with the following format:

 BOT OF FILE                             Examples

 The first line (MENU NAME) is the name of the menu (used by @OPTEXT@ in
     prompts)

|The second line (DISPLAY FILE NAME) is the base name of a display file
|    for this menu (may have alternates).  There may be up to three extra
|    fields (FORCE FLAG, HOT FLAG, & PASS THROUGH) after this to control
|    forcing display of the file regardless of the users expert status, to
|    activate menu hot keys, & to pass undefined options through to PCBoard.
|
|    If FORCE FLAG is specified and non-0 then the file will be displayed
|    regardless of the users expert status; if 0 or not specified then display
|    of the file will follow the users expert status.
|
|    If HOT FLAG is specified and non-0 then hot keys will be used; if 0 or not
|    specified then normal command stacking processing will be used.
|
|    If PASS THROUGH is specified and non-0 and an undefined option is entered
|    by the user then it will be passed on to PCBoard for processing; if 0 or
|    not specified then no action will be taken on an undefined option.

 The third line (HELP FILE NAME) is the base name of a help file for this
     menu (may have alternates)

 The fourth line (LANGUAGE SPECIFIC PROMPT COUNT) is used to tell PCBoard
     if, and how many, language prompts you have defined for this menu.
     If 0 then a default prompt from PCBTEXT will be used.

 The fifth line (DEFAULT LANGUAGE MENU PROMPT) is only used if the third
     line is greater than 0.  If it is, this is the default language
     prompt that will be used if a language specific version of the
|    prompt can't be found.  Note that file and PPE replacements are
|    valid in v15.1.

 The sixth and possibly seventh (or more) lines (EXT,LANGUAGE SPECIFIC
     PROMPT) are only used if the third line is greater than 1.  If this
     is true, there should be (third line - 1) lines with language
     specific prompts.  The EXT portion of each line should include the
|    dot in front of the extension (ie, .SPA).  Note that file and PPE
|    replacements are valid in v15.1.

 The eighth line (OPTION COUNT) should contain a count of available
     options.

 The ninth (and greater) lines (OPT,SEC,TYPE,INFO) are used to define the
     option information for each option.


 Here is an example MNU file for conferences.

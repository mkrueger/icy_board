The following information covers the file format used by the account tracking
file (both .DBF and .TXT formats) which PCBoard uses to track user activities
and the debits and credits associated with them.


   "Account Tracking File" - This file is used to track the user's activities
   on your system and the charges (and reimbursements) that are made.  When
   you define the name for this file you are also instructing PCBoard as to
   how it should create the file.  For instance, if you name it TRACKING.DBF
   then PCBoard will write to it in DBF format.  Any file extension other than
   .DBF will be treated as an ASCII text file.

   NOTE:  The Account Tracking File can be SHARED among all of your nodes by
   pointing to the same physical file in all of your node configurations.
   PCBoard will properly append each new record to the end of that file.
   However, due to the frequency of the updates, you may want to have each node
   post to its own file just to make the updates quicker.  Either way works
   fine, the latter approach, however, may create a little extra work for you
   in having to analyze and/or combine the files when billing your customers.

   As a dBase file, the following fields are defined:

      Field Name  Type  Len  Dec  Description
      ==========  ====  ===  ===  ===========
      Date        'D'     8       Date when the activity occured
      Time        'C'     5       Time when the activity occured
      Name        'C'    25       The name of the user performing the activity
      NodeNumber  'N'     5   0   The node number on which the activity worked
      ConfNumber  'N'     5   0   The conference the caller was in at the time
      Activity    'C'    15       Text abbreviation of the activity
      SubAct      'C'    25       Filenames, etc.  See below.
      UnitCost    'N'    14   4   Per-Unit cost (per minute, per byte, etc)
      Quantity    'N'     9   0   Number of units (minutes, bytes, etc)
      Value       'N'    14   4   Total cost or payback (UnitCost * Quantity)

   The Activity values, used by PCBoard, are as follows:

      Activity        Sub-Activity          Explanation of Value
      ==============  ====================  ==================================

      MSG WRITE ECHO  TO: name              Cost to write echoed message
      DNLD FILE       File name downloaded  Cost to download the file
      DNLD BYTES      File name downloaded  Cost to download the file
      UPLD FILE       File name uploaded    Cost/reward to upload the file
      UPLD BYTES      File name uploaded    Cost/reward to upload the file
      UPLD FILE FAIL  File name uploaded    Backing out charge/reward for upld
      UPLD BYTES FAIL File name uploaded    Backing out charge/reward for upld
      CHAT TIME                             Cost for min spent in Group Chat
      CONF TIME                             Cost for min spent in conference

      LOGON           LOCAL or BPS rate     Cost for logging onto the system

   All values are positive if they are to be subtracted from the balance,
   negative if they are to be added into the balance.  In other words, if you
   reward your callers for uploads, then they will show up as negative values
   in the account tracking file.

   NOTE: Additional activities, subactivities, and charges may be posted via
   programs written in PPL.

   The ASCII text version of the account tracking file is identical to the
   above as far as content is concerned.  The layout is one record per line,
   with all fields, except the last one, padded to their full length.  The
   format, then, looks like this:

     Date       8 characters, left justified
                1 character - separator
     Time       5 characters, left justified
                1 character - separator
     Name      25 characters, left justified
                1 character - separator
     NodeNum    5 characters, right justified, padded on left with spaces
                1 character - separator
     ConfNum    5 characters, right justified, padded on left with spaces
                1 character - separator
     Activity  15 characters, left justified
                1 character - separator
     SubAct    25 characters, left justified
                1 character - separator
     UnitCost  14 characters, right justified with 4 decimal places
                1 character - separator
     Quantity   9 characters, right justified
                1 character - separator
     Value     14 characters, right justified, with 4 decimal places
                2 characters - CR/LF

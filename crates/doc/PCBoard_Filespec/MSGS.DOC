  The following information documents the format for PCBoard's message base
  and message index formats.

  The message base consists of 128-byte blocks of data.  A single 128 byte
  header is placed at the start of each message base giving information such
  as the number of messages in the message base and the low to high range of
  message numbers within the message base.

  Each individual message subsequently consists of a 128-byte header
  describing who the message is to and from and an indicator of how many
  128-byte blocks comprise the entire message.

  The following layout is specified in a "byte offset" format such that the
  first field begins at offset 0.

  The following is a definition of the variable types that will be used below:

    char   = a 1 byte character
    str    = an array of 2 or more "char" bytes
    bsreal = a 4 byte Basic Single Precision real number
|   int    = a 2 byte integer
|   long   = a 4 byte integer
|   bitmap = a single byte with individual bits set on or off

  Note that strings are not NULL terminated and that the length specified for
  the string is full number of useable and storeable bytes.  All strings are
  padded with spaces to fill the entire field.

|    127    bitmap     1    Extended Header Flags
|    128    char       1    Reserved for future use


| Extended Header Format
| ----------------------
| A mesage may contain one or more EXTENDED HEADERS within the body of the
| message.  Please refer to HEADERS.DOC for a discussion of each of these
| headers and their uses.
|
| The following is the physical layout of the Extended Header within the
| message body.  You may assume that as soon as the Extended Header ID is not
| found that there are no more extended headers in the message body.
|
|   Offset   Type   Length  Description
|   ------  ------  ------  -----------
|      0    int        2    Extended Header ID = must be equal to 40FFh
|      2    str        7    Extended Header Function
|      9    char       1    A colon (:) character
|     10    str       60    Extended Header Description (subj, to, from, etc)
|     70    char       1    Status (N or R)
|     71    char       1    Line Separator (E3h, or 0Dh for foreign systems)
|
| While any value may be used for the Extended Header Function field, the only
| values recognized and processed directly by PCBoard v15.0 are:
|
|   "TO     "      TO Name (or address for internet)
|   "FROM   "      FROM Name (or address for internet)
|   "SUBJECT"      Subject of the message
|   "ATTACH "      File Attachment
|   "LIST   "      Carbon List TO Name
|   "ROUTE  "      Routing information for netmail
|   "ORIGIN "      Origin information for netmail
|   "REQRR  "      Request Return Receipt
|   "ACKRR  "      Acknowledgement Return Receipt
|   "ACKNAME"      Acknowledgement (FROM) Name
|   "PACKOUT"      Pack Out Date (date to remove message)
|
| The Carbon List header Description Field is further subdivided as follows:
|
|   Offset   Type   Length  Description
|   ------  ------  ------  -----------
|     10    str       50    Extended Header Description (subj, to, from, etc)
|     60    str        6    Date Message Was Read
|     66    str        4    Time Message Was Read
|
| The File Attach header Description Field is formatted as follows:
|
|     "FILENAME (SIZE) STOREDNAME"
|
| The entire field is padded out to 60 spaces just like the rest of the
| extended headers.  The FILENAME is the name of the file that the caller
| uploaded.  The SIZE is the size of the file.  The STOREDNAME is the name
| under which the file is actually stored on disk.


  Index File Format
  -----------------
| There are now two separate Index File Formats used by PCBoard.  There is an
| older format which was used from the beginning, and a new v15.0 specific
| format.
|
| We encourage all authors to upgrade to the v15.0 format.  However, in the
| meantime, PCBoard is capable of working with BOTH formats.  PCBoard will
| no longer USE the old style format, but it will keep it up to date for
| those programs that need to access it.  This functionality can be disabled
| if the system does not make use of any software that uses the old style
| format and this can save both time and disk space.
|
| The two index filenames are the same root name as used for the message base
| plus the addition of an extension as follows:
|
|        .NDX      for old-style index files
|        .IDX      for v15.0 style index files
|
| Example:  MSGS.NDX and MSGS.IDX would be the two index files for MSGS.
|
| Version 15.0 Style Index
| ------------------------
| This new format has several changes and at the same time some operational
| simularities that make it easy to implement.  These changes are:
|
| - The index record now has the offset stored as a long integer instead of as
|   a single precision real number.
|
| - The offset is no longer the number of the message block but instead is the
|   actual offset within the file.  (the old style offset had to be multiplied
|   by 128 to arrive at a physical offset)
|
| - The index record now has the most commonly accessed information that is
|   used by PCBoard to determine the accessability of a message - that is,
|   to decide whether or not the message can be read by the caller.  By putting
|   all of this information into the index PCBoard no longer has to read BOTH
|   the index AND the message header to find out of the message is readable.
|   This also greatly speeds up the Y-scan because for most scans it no longer
|   has to read the message base but just the information in the index file can
|   be used.
|
| - A date is now included in the index making it possible to quickly locate
|   messages that are newer than a given date.
|
| - The index file is not PRE-formatted.  This means that sysops no longer
|   have to worry about filling up the message base index or setting an
|   appropriate "block size" for the index.  PCBoard and PCBPack simply
|   maintain an index that covers only the range of messages from low to high
|   in the message base and nothinger more.
|
| The format for the index is as follows:
|
|   Offset   Type   Length  Description
|   ------  ------  ------  -----------
|      0    long       4    Offset (0 if none, >0 if active, <0 if killed)
|      4    long       4    Message Number
|      8    str       25    TO Name
|     33    str       25    FROM Name
|     58    char       1    Status Character (from Message Header)
|     59    int        2    Date of Message (in julian date format)
|     61    str        3    Reserved for future use
|
| Accessing the file is quite similar to the old style index.  Here is the
| same example used for the Old Style Index access:
|
|    Message Number to Find:   1500
|
|    Low Message Number    :   1024
|    Offset into INDEX File:   1500-1024 = 476, 476*64 = 30464
|                              read 64 bytes at offset 30464 in INDEX file
|    Offset into MSGS File :   Index.Offset
|
| The differences in the above as compared to Old Style Indexes are that the
| size of the index record is now 64 bytes instead of 4 bytes.  And the Offset
| in the record is used "as is" without having to perform any calculations
| on it.
|
| Example C code implementing the above:
|
|        typedef struct {
|          long     Offset;
|          long     Num;
|          char     To[25];
|          char     From[25];
|          char     Status;
|          unsigned Date;
|          char     Reserved[3];
|        } indextype;
|
|        indextype Index;
|
|        LowNum = 1024;
|        MsgNum = 1500;
|        lseek(IndexFile,(MsgNum-LowNum)*sizeof(indextype),SEEK_SET);
|        read(IndexFile,&Index,sizeof(indextype));
|
|        if (Index.Offset > 0) {
|          lseek(MsgsFile,Offset,SEEK_SET);
|          read(MsgsFile,Header,sizeof(Header));
|          /* read the rest of the message here if you want */
|        }
|
| The offsets contained in the index file will be 0 (indicating that no
| message exists for that entry), a negative of the offset (example -476 in
| the above) if the message has been killed or a positive offset value if the
| message is active.


  Old Style Index
  ---------------
  The file is preformatted to a size of 4096 times the number of message index
  blocks.  Each message index block consists of 1024 entries each being of
  type "bsreal" resulting in 4096 bytes per block.

  Each entry in the index is the block offset into the message base for a
  given message number minus the low message number in the message base.  Take
  the following example for instance:

     Message Number to Find:   1500

     Low Message Number    :   1024
     Offset into INDEX File:   1500-1024 = 476, 476*4 = 1904
                               read 4 bytes at offset 1904 in INDEX file
                               (realizing that those 4 bytes are "bsreal")
     Offset into MSGS File :   (Value from Index - 1) * 128

  The Offset into the MSGS file is then calculated according to the above
  example by first determining where to read in the index file, grabbing the
  block offset value from the index and then subtracting one from it and
  multiplying by 128 (which is the size of all blocks in the message base).

  Example C code implementing the above:

         LowNum = 1024;
         MsgNum = 1500;
         lseek(IndexFile,(MsgNum-LowNum)*4,SEEK_SET);
         read(IndexFile,Offset,sizeof(bsreal));

         MsgOffset = Offset;    /* <-- using your own routines you need */
                                /*     to convert the bsreal type to a  */
                                /*     long integer for use below       */

         if (MsgOffset > 0) {
           lseek(MsgsFile,(MsgOffset-1)*128,SEEK_SET);
           read(MsgsFile,Header,sizeof(Header));
           /* read the rest of the message here if you want */
         }

  The offsets contained in the index file will be 0 (indicating that no
  message exists for that entry), a negative of the offset (example -476 in
  the above) if the message has been killed or a positive offset value if the
  message is active.


  Note 1:
  -------
  In the past, to lock the message base while inserting messages, PCBoard put
  the word "LOCKED" at position 16 and locked the first 128 bytes of the file
  which made up the entire HEADER region of the file.  This 'lock' was placed
  on the file so that other nodes on the network could not update the file at
  the same time.

  The word "LOCKED" was used because some systems would not properly lock a
  range of bytes within a file.  This method, however, causes a problem if a
  system is rebooted (or locked up) prior to unlocking the file leaving it in
  a "locked" state and unavailable for further system use.

  Version 14.5 will now lock ONLY the 6 bytes starting at offset 16 (16 bytes
  from the start of the file which is byte #17 if you start counting at 1).
  These 6 bytes have always been defined as the "LOCKED" bytes since v14.0 and
  in effect were always locked anyway since a lock on the first 128 bytes
  included those 6 bytes.  Therefore programs that were originally designed to
  work with v14.0 should continue to work properly unmodified!

  The advantage to locking only the 6 bytes at offset 16 is that the first 16
  bytes are still READABLE and that any node or process wishing to read the
  first 16 bytes is now allowed to do so.

  For instance, a (R)ead command or a (Y)our Mail command will now be allowed
  to proceed WHILE the message base is being updated.  Previously those
  functions would be required to wait until the lock was removed before they
  could proceed with reading the header bytes (which defined the 'High Message
  Number', the 'Low Message Number', the 'Number of Active Messages' and the
  'Number of System Callers').

  It is recommended that Third Party Authors use the same technique now for
  updating the message base EVEN THOUGH the old method of locking all 128
  bytes will continue to work fine.  The reason for the change was to enhance
  the performance of systems where a large number of people could be reading
  mail while a large number of messages are being written into the message
  base.


  Note 2:
  -------
  The status flags used by PCBoard for message read control are:
 ÿ
     ( ) - A message which can be read by anyone.
     (*) - A private message to a specific person which has NOT
           been read by the "addressed to" person.
     (+) - A private message which HAS been read by the person
           it was addressed to.
     (-) - A message to a specific person, which was readble by anyone,
           which has been read by the person it was addressed to.
     (~) - A COMMENT to the sysop which has NOT been read by the
           person defined as sysop record #1.
     (`) - A COMMENT to the sysop which HAS been read by the person
           defined as sysop record #1.
     (%) - A message protected by SENDER PASSWORD which has not been read
     (^) - A message protected by SENDER PASSWORD which has been read
     (!) - A message protected by GROUP PASSWORD which has not been read
     (#) - A message protected by GROUP PASSWORD which has been read
     ($) - A message protected by GROUP PASSWORD which is addressed to ALL


  Note 3:
  -------
  It should be noted that the number of message blocks indicated within the
  message header includes the header block itself in the count.  In other
  words, if a message has a body length of 1 block the number stored in the
  header would be 2 counting both the message header and the body block.

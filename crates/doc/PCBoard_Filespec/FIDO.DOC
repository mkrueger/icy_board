		      File format for All FIDO data files

WARNING: This document is subject to change at any time.

================================================================================

The data types used here are as follows

int		2 byte signed	     integer
unsigned int	2 byte unsigned      integer
long		4 byte signed	long integer
unsigned long	4 byte unsigned long integer
char		1 byte character


PCBFIDO.CFG
-----------

First two bytes are an unsigned integer file version. PCBoard 15.22 data files
have a version number of 3, where as 15.21 data files have a version number
of 2.

The rest of the file contains three data structures.

Here is a list of all FIDO information stored in PCBFIDO.CFG
- Directory Information for FIDO
- EMSI Profile
- Freq Restrictions
- Archivers used by FIDO

So this file contains a data structure for each of the four items stored
in the same order. The structure is as follows.

FIDOQUEUE.DAT
-------------

The record structure for this file has not changed since version 15.21. However,
the first 128 byte header has been replaced with a 2 byte file version. Also
note that deleted records are packed out as soon as they are deleted so you
are less likely to find empty records.

Byte Offset	type			 datum

0-1		 unsigned short 	 file version (15.22 = 3)
2-82		 char			 filename
83-108		 char			 nodestr (fido address)
109-110 	 unsigned short 	 flag (CRASH HOLD)
111-112 	 unsigned short 	 failed connect count
113		 char			 Read only flag
114-132 	 char			 reserved


typedef struct
{
  char filename[80];			/* Name of outgoing file. Full path  */
  char nodestr[25];			/* Node to receive the file.	     */
  int  flag;				/* Attribute (Kill-sent, crash,etc.) */
  int  failedConnects;			/* Number of failed connections      */
  bool readOnly;			/* Can this entry be modified by event processing */
  char reserved[18];			/* Reserved			     */
} QUEUE_RECORD;


Here are the flags used in the flag field


Q_POLL	      1 	 /* Entry is a POLL			     */
Q_FILEREQ     2 	 /* Entry is a file request
Q_KILLSENT    4 	 /* file is deleted after it is sent (When queue record is removed)
Q_HOLD	      8 	 /* Entry is marked as HOLD
Q_CRASH       16	 /* Entry is marked as CRASH
Q_NORMAL      32	 /* Entry is marked as NORMAL
Q_POLLED      64	 /* Entry is a POLL that has already executed
Q_FILESEND    128	 /* Entry has file to be sent
Q_OUTBOUND    256	 /* Entry will go out with next call
Q_FREQED      1024	 /* Entry is FREQ that has been completed


If an entry is marked as OUTBOUND then pcboard will send it out at the next
dial sequence. Those marked as NORMAL will only go out when an event allows
it. An entry marked as CRASH must also have the OUTBOUND flag set.

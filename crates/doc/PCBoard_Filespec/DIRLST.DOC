The following documents the format of the DIR.LST files that PCBoard uses to
store the LIST of "DIR Files" that PCBoard uses to determine which DIR fils
should be displayed.

typedef struct {
  char DirPath[30];
  char DskPath[30];
  char DirDesc[35];
  char SortType;
} dirlisttype;

DirPath is the complete path and filename of the DIR file to be displayed.

DskPath is the physical path location where files *associated* with the DIR
file can be found.

DirDesc is the text description of the DIR file.

SortType is one of the following:  0 - no sort
                                   1 - Sort by File Name (ascending)
                                   2 - Sort by File Date (ascending)
                                   3 - Sort by File Name (descending)
                                   4 - Sort by File Date (descending)


For a format of the actual DIR files (which are just text files) take a look
at the DIR.DOC file.

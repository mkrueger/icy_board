  The following information documents the order in which the fields of the
  PCBOARD.DAT file are layed out.  All fields are written in an ASCII text
  format with a carriage return/line feed after each field making one field
  per line in the file.

  On questions of a YES or NO nature in PCBSETUP the values are stored in the
  PCBOARD.DAT file as a "-1" for YES or a "0" for NO.

| For version 14.0 thru 14.2 lines 1 thru 150 apply.  Lines 151-198 are
| new for version 14.5.  Lines 199-266 are new for v15.0.  Lines 267-272 are
| new for v15.1.  Lines xxx-xxx are new for v15.2.

  A program that is written to READ this file should only read those lines
  which it needs and should check line number 1 (the version identification)
  to be sure that it is compatible with the software being used.

  A program that is written to WRITE to this file should first read in ALL of
  the existing lines and copy back out the ones that go unchanged.  Note that
  the total number of lines may INCREASE without notice.  Therefore you should
  write the program to continue reading until an EOF (end of file) condition
  occurs and then write out all of the lines.  This will preserve compatibility
  with future changes in the PCBOARD.DAT file.

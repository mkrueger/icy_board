  The following information documents the format for PCBoard's PWRD file.

  The PWRD file consists of one line per security level / password combination.

  The most important aspect of the PWRD file is that, like other PCBoard files,
  such as the FSEC file, PCBoard STOPS searching the file AS SOON as a match
  is found.  PCBoard does not search for a "best fit" match.  It finds the
  "first match" and then stops looking.

  When reading the file, the match is made based on the security level and
  password fields.

  If the password field is blank, then only the security level is used to
  find the match.  That is, PCBoard uses the caller's CURRENT security level
  to locate the first line that matches.

  If the password field is non-blank, then PCBoard attempts to match both
  the caller's CURRENT security level AND the caller's password.  If a match is
  made, then that line is used.  If the not, the line is skipped and PCBoard
  searches for another match.

  The format of the file looks something like this:

|      ,10,30,32767,0,99,0,0,0,0,Y,N,N,N,N,0,0,T

  Each field is comma delimited.  The order of the fields are as follows:

   1) Password
   2) Security Level
   3) Time Limit (per day, unless Enforce Time is set to NO, then per session)
   4) Daily K-Byte Limit
   5) Base Baud Rate (for adjusting Daily K-Byte Limit)
   6) Batch Limit (max files in a single download batch)
   7) File Ratio (stored as 10 TIMES the ratio; e.g. 5.0 is stored as 50)
   8) Byte Ratio (stored as 10 TIMES the ratio; e.g. 5.0 is stored as 50)
   9) Total File Limit  (max files can download until sysop resets count)
  10) Total KByte Limit (max K-bytes can download until sysop resets count)
  11) Enforce Time Limit (NO means time limit is a per-session limit)
  12) Allow Alias to be used
  13) Force caller to read personal mail on login
  14) Allow multiple users to access current user-id simultaneously
  15) Verify Caller by checkin Verification PSA
  16) File Ratio Credits (credits towards upload file count)
  17) KByte Ratio Credits (credits towards upload byte count - in K)
| 18) Accounting Enabled (Y = yes, N = No, T = Tracking Only)

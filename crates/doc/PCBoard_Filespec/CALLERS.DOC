The CALLERS log is a random access text file with a record length of 64
bytes.

The following layout is specified in a "byte offset" format such that the first
field begins at offset 0.

Note that strings are not NULL terminated and that the length specified for
the string is full number of useable and storeable bytes.  All strings are
padded with spaces to fill the entire field.

   Offset   Type   Length  Description
   ------  ------  ------  -----------
      0    str       62    The actual text written to the log
     62    str        2    Carriage Return / Line Feed characters

While the each record is strictly formatted to 64 bytes each making it a
random access file - the file may be TYPE'd to the screen at a DOS prompt due
to the inclusion of the carriage return and line feed characters at the end of
each record.

PCBoard, when displaying the callers log, takes advantage of the random access
nature of the file format to be able to display the file in reverse order.

The following information describes the PCBSTATS.DAT file which PCBoard
maintains with information about the activity on the system and displays to
the sysop on the call waiting screen.

There is one record in the file for every node on the system, plus on
additional record, at the top of the file, for the system statistics.  Each
record has the following structure:

  typedef struct {
    char LastCaller[54];
    char Time[6];
    long NewMsgs;
    long NewCalls;
    long TotalUp;
    long TotalDn;
    bool LocalStats;         ;bool is a char type with a 0 or 1 value
  } stattype;

So record #0 is the system record, record #1 belongs to node #1, record #2
belongs to node #2 and so on.

When PCBoard updates this file, it updates *both* the local node statistics
as well as the system statistics.  For example, if JOHN DOE logs off, his
name appears in the local node record plus it is written to the system record.

In this manner, the sysop can look at "system wide statistics" or he can switch
to a specific node and look at "node specific statistics".

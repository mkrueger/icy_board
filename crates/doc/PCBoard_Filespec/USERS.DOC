  The following information documents the format for PCBoard's USERS file
  and index files format.  The format of the USERS.INF file is documented
  separately in a file called USERSYS.DOC.

  Each user record is 400 bytes in length.  There are no headers or other
  special considerations contained within the users file.  Therefore, a
  users file with 4 user records would be 1600 bytes in length.

  The following layout is specified in a "byte offset" format such that the
  first field begins at offset 0.

  The following is a definition of the variable types that will be used below:

    int    = a 2 byte value used to form an unsigned integer word
    long   = a 4 byte value used to form a long integer
    char   = a 1 byte character
    str    = an array of 2 or more "char" bytes
    bsreal = a 4 byte Basic Single Precision real number
    bdreal = an 8 byte Basic Double Precision real number
    bitmap = 1 or more bytes used to store bit flags

  Note that strings are not NULL terminated and that the length specified for
  the string is full number of useable and storeable bytes.  All strings are
  padded with spaces to fill the entire field.

  Bit Flags
  ---------
  The bit flags are used to store the status of several flags using only a
  single byte to store them.  They are stored in the following order:

  Bit 0 = Dirty Flag (used to indicate another process updated the record)
  Bit 1 = Clear Screen Between Messages
  Bit 2 = Has Mail Flag
  Bit 3 = Don't Ask for Full Screen Editor Use
  Bit 4 = Full Screen Editor Default
| Bit 5 = Scroll Message Body
| Bit 6 = Use Short Message Headers
| Bit 7 = Use Wide (79-column) Editor

| Bit Flags 2
| -----------
| The bit flags are used to store the status of several flags using only a
| single byte to store them.  They are stored in the following order:
|
| Bit 0 = Chat Status - OFF=Available, ON=unavailable
| Bit 1 = reserved
| Bit 2 = reserved
| Bit 3 = reserved
| Bit 4 = reserved
| Bit 5 = reserved
| Bit 6 = reserved
| Bit 7 = reserved

  USER INDEX FILES
  ================

    Offset   Type   Length  Description
    ------  ------  ------  -----------
       0    int        2    Record Number in USERS File
       2    str       25    Full Name

  There are 26 separate index files for the users.  They are separated into
  PCNDX.A thru PCBNDX.Z storing names beginning with the letters "A" thru "Z"
  respectively.  Names starting with character before ascii "A" are stored in
  the PCBNDX.A file and similarly names starting with characters after ascii
  "A" are stored in the PCBNDX.Z file.

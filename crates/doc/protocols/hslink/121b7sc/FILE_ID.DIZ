HS/Link External Protocol 1.21B7 FULL SOURCE
--------------------------------------------
My offices were burglarized and my main
software development system stolen, complete
with latest backup tapes. I am posting what
source code I could dig up, in the hopes that
others may eventually benefit from my past
work, and to keep the protocol alive, at
least in some changed form.

             SUMMARY OF WHAT'S NEW IN HS/LINK VERSION 1.20
  ==========================================================================

  HS/Link version 1.20 corrects all known problems in version 1.12 and adds a
  number of new features and options.  This version can successfully connect
  and transfer files with prior HS/Link release versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.12.
  Earlier "Alpha" (à) or "Beta" (á) version numbers represent unfinished
  versions and should not be used.

  HS/Link version 1.20 is a direct replacement for version 1.12 and does not
  require any change in command line options or configuration options. There
  are a number of NEW options you may want to take a look at.

  The most important new feature is the "CHAT" function, which allows you to
  CHAT with the remote user during a file transfer. You must have a registered
  copy of HS/Link to initiate a CHAT. Unregistered copies can still CHAT if a
  remote registered copy initiates the CHAT.

  The following options have been added or enhanced:

     -CPn    Control the position of the status display.  Use a setting of -CP0
             to move HSLINK's display UP so that the bottom two lines will be
             untouched.

     -FTn    Control NS16550AN Fifo Threshold.  Higher thresholds reduce
             interrupt overhead but increase the chances of a receiver OVERRUN
             error under multi-taskers such as Desqview and Windows.

     -I4     Give up idle time under Windows, OS/2, DOS 5 and other
             environments that support the "int 2fh/ax=1680h" idle call.

     -N!     Do not force remote to use local settings.  Will override any
             previous -! option in either the command line or a configuration
             file.

     -NA     Disable Alternate XON/XOFF method for compatibility with versions
             1.0 and 1.12.

     -NEn    Controls the number of repeated errors that will abort a file
             transfer.

     -NG     Do not allow Control-G (BEEP) characters in CHAT mode. This keeps
             remote callers from beeping your speaker during a file transfer.

     -NK     Do not keep aborted downloads.  Will override any previous -K
             option in either the command line or a configuration file.

     -T      If you include -T in the HSLINK command line, you will be placed
             into a simple mini terminal emulation prior to starting the
             transfer.


  ==========================================================================
                DETAILED LIST OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20
  ==========================================================================

   Added -CP option to control the position of the status display.  The default
   is -CP2, which causes HSLINK to leave the top 2 lines untouched. Use a
   setting of -CP0 to move HSLINK's display UP so that the bottom two lines
   will be untouched.  This solves problems with some BBS softwares that
   protect the bottom two lines of the screen.

   Added -FTn option to control NS16550 Fifo Threshold.  Possible values are
   -FT1, -FT4, -FT8, -FT14.  Higher thresholds reduce interrupt overhead but
   increase the chances of a receiver OVERRUN error under multi-taskers such as
   Desqview and Windows. The default is now -FT4.

   Added -I4 option to give up idle time under Windows, OS/2, DOS 5 and other
   environments that support the "int 2fh/ax=1680h" idle call.

   Added -N! (do not force remote to use local settings) option to override any
   previous -! option in either the command line or a configuration file.

   Added -NE option to control the number of repeated errors that will abort a
   file transfer.  The default is to abort at 20 consequtive errors, but some
   users may wish to set this to a higher or lower number.

   Added -NG option to block Control-G (BEEP) characters in CHAT mode. This
   keeps remote callers from beeping your speaker during a file transfer.

   Added -NK (do not keep aborted downloads) option to override any previous -K
   option in either the command line or a configuration file.

   Added a check for
        SET HSERR=path\logfile
   to enable a new error logging facility.  When enabled, most screen
   information and error messages are logged to the specified logfile.

   Added a mini terminal feature.  If you include -T in the HSLINK command
   line, you will be placed into a simple terminal emulation prior to starting
   the transfer.

   Added logic to allow the link to continue in CHAT mode when all file
   transfers are completed.  The link will terminate when CHAT is manually
   terminated with ESC or when 30 seconds of idle time elapse.

   Added logic to automatically reduce 'window' size when flow control appears
   to be failing.  This helps to save failing PC Pursuit sessions.

   Added logic to cancel a link when the same error is reported ten times in
   sequence.

   Added logic to detect failure of flow control to suspend flow in slow
   handshake mode prior to disk activity.  When flow continues for 3 seconds
   after flow control is asserted, the message Warning: Flow control failure!
   Slow handshake disabled. will be displayed and the -HS option will be
   disengaged for the rest of the session.

   Added logic to force a special COMM driver mode when -FT16 and higher are
   specified.  In this mode attempts will be made to perform multiple character
   i/o per interrupt service, even when the UART appears to be an 8250 or
   16540.  This logic may improve the performance with some internal modems,
   such as the Forval, but may cause the transfer to fail with others. Use with
   caution.

   Added logic to give priority to the lower serial numbered copy when two
   registered copies attempt to use the -! option.  This may save transfers
   that would otherwise fail due to conflicting setting overrides.

   Added logic to insure proper operation under marginal memory conditions.

   Added logic to prevent internal transmit queue overflows when using large
   blocks and very high effective speed settings.

   Added logic to warn the user when an invalid registration code is entered,
   rather than triggering the tamper detection logic.

   Changed initial handshake logic to default to new alternate XON/XOFF
   encoding method, instead of first attempting the old method.  This should
   speed up the initial handshake process and also prevent some occasional
   handshake failures.  Added -NA option to disable this logic for
   compatibility with release 1.12 and earlier.

   Changed transfer abort logic to exit more quickly if ^X is typed 6 or more
   times.  Otherwise HSLINK will wait for remote data flow to stop before
   releasing control.

   Changes in batch status window calculation to base time estimate on the
   direction with the most estimated TIME remaining rather than the batch with
   the most BYTES remaining to transfer.  This should prevent the estimates
   from jumping around as much.

   Changes to eliminate all remaining false "exit code 2" conditions following
   a successful transfer.

   Corrected HSCONFIG to set MONO default colors only when a new configuration
   file is being created.

   Correction in batch status totals when files are skipped in the incoming
   files window.

   Implemented proper RTS handshake in addition to XON/XOFF when receive buffer
   nears overflow.

   Internal changes to correct operation with the internal Intel Satisfaxion
   Modem/400E.

   Internal changes to guard the codes 0x91 and 0x93 when XON/XOFF handshake is
   enabled.  This change was required because some common FOSSIL drivers accept
   these codes as alternates for the normal 0x11 and 0x13 XON/XOFF codes.  This
   solves problems with XON/XOFF handshake via PC Pursuit.  The remote must be
   running version 1.13á or later for this logic to go into effect.

   Internal changes to protect the CR-@-CR sequence used by PC Pursuit to
   escape to a command mode.

   Internal changes to reduce memory requirements by about 10k compared to
   earlier versions.  Hslink works best with about 103000 bytes of ram, but
   will now work successfully with at little as 78000 bytes.

   Note: When running HS/Link in Windows Enhanced mode and you are getting COM
   Overrun errors, you may need to add the following statement in the [386Enh]
   section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
        COM1BUFFER=8192         ;if you are using COM1, or
        COM2BUFFER=8192         ;if you are using COM2

   The following ERRORLEVEL codes are now possible:

      ERRORLEVEL     Reason for link termination
      ----------     ----------------------------------------
         0           One or more files transferred successfully
         1           ^X typed at local keyboard
         2           ^X received over COM port
         3           Incompatible BETA versions
         4           No files transmitted or received
         5           Remote did not respond within 2 minutes
         6           Too many framing errors, possible -B mismatch
         7           Possible tampering or corruption in HSLINK.EXE
         8           Possible tampering or corruption in HSLINK.EXE
         9           COM port not responding, incorrect -P options
        10           Carrier lost during initial handshake with remote
        11           Link aborted due to CTS lockup
        12           Bad command line or config file option
        13           Repeated identical errors in excess of -NE setting

   The HS/Link program and installation tips files are now available via FTP at
   simtel20.army.mil in PD1:<MSDOS.MODEM> !!!

   The most reliable operation under Microsoft Windows seems to occur when the
   -N5 option is used, even if the COM port actually does have the NS16550AN
   attached.

   The new CHAT mode is now a "registered" feature.  If you are running an
   unregistered copy of HSLINK, you will not be able to INITIATE a CHAT, but
   you can CHAT with the remote if the remote is registered and initiates the
   CHAT.

   The new FOSSIL version of HS/Link was created.  See FHSLINK.EXE and
   FHSLINK.DOC for details.

   To initiate a CHAT, just hit ENTER ... two CHAT windows will pop up and you
   will have a two-way CHAT.  Press the ESCAPE key to close the CHAT windows.
   The remote must be using version 1.13à or newer.

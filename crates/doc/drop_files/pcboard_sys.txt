  The following file documents the format of the PCBOARD.SYS file including the
  fields which have been standard throughout the PCBoard version 14.x series as
  well as the new v15.0 software.

  The file may be written in one of two modes:  1) as a 128 byte file which is
  compatible with the PCBoard v14.x series or 2) as a complete file including
  all of the extensions added in the v14.5 release.

  In any case the file should be pre-filled with spaces inside the first 128
  bytes so that any field not written is filled with spaces instead of zeroes
  or other characters.  Typically this only really matters when a caller is not
  online at which time only the first five fields inside of the 128 byte block
  are valid.  The rest of the fields outside of the 128 byte block may contain
  valid data or the file may be truncated to 128 bytes without serious loss of
  data.

| As a door author wanting to provide LOGOFF PROCESSING in your door, what we
| recommend is that you do NOT process the logoff yourself, but instead,
| return to PCBoard and let PCBoard perform the logoff processing.  This is a
| matter of convenience for you, since PCBoard can grow and change and you will
| not need to modify your application whenever the logoff processing is
| enhanced.  If you still wish to offer a GOODBYE command, what we recommend
| is that you simply turn DTR off and then return back to PCBoard.  PCBoard
| will then detect carrier loss and process the logoff for you.
|
| If you still want to perform the logoff processing yourself, here are a few
| of the "current" details of what is necessary:
|
| 1) You will need to empty the pcboard.sys file.  You do that by filling the
|    file, from offset 9 to offset 127, with spaces, leaving everything else
|    inside of the file intact.
|
| 2) You will need to update the user record in the USERS file for the amount
|    of time spent online (don't forget to correctly calculate time used when
|    crossing midnight).
|
| 3) If accounting is enabled, charge the caller for time used and write the
|    information to the account tracking file (in text format or dBase format
|    as appropriate to the extension of that file).
|
| 4) Update the PCBSTATS.DAT file with the last caller information.
|
| 5) Run the $$LOGOFF.BAT file if it exists.
|
| NOTE:  The above steps may change as PCBoard's features continue to be
| enhanced.  In some ways, I hope the above set of steps appears daunting
| enough to convince you to just let PCBoard do the logoff processing for you.
| One more advantage is that, in doing so, that is one less thing for you to
| have to do, and one less problem for you to figure out if it is done wrong.

  The following layout is specified in a "byte offset" format such that the
  first field begins at offset 0.

  The following is a definition of the variable types that will be used below:

   char   = a 1 byte character
   str    = an array of 2 or more "char" bytes
   int    = a 2 byte integer
   long   = a 4 byte long integer
   bsreal = a 4 byte Basic Single Precision real number
   bitmap = an array of bytes accessed a bit at a time

  Note 1
  ------
  The "Time Allowed On" field is not the calculated allowed time remaining.
  The user's record in the USERS file is not updated with the "Last Date On" or
  "Elapsed Time On" information so far that day before the program exits to
  either perform a DOS function or run a DOOR program.  DOOR programs,
  therefore, should not update the USERS file in their application if the
  caller is returning to PCBoard.  Only if the caller hangs up inside the DOOR
  and the DOOR modifies PCBOARD.SYS should the file be changed.


  Note 2
  ------
  The "Allowed K-Bytes for Download" field specifies the number of K-bytes the
  caller may download in a day according to the PWRD file and his security
  level and his connect speed (if specified in the PWRD file).

  This is not the calculated number of K-bytes remaining.  To calculate the
  number of bytes the caller may download you must multiply this number by 1024
  and subtract from it the number of bytes the caller has downloaded today.

  Unlike the "Elapsed Time On" field the "Number of Bytes Downloaded" field is
  updated before PCBoard exits to DOS or to a DOOR program.

  Note that if the number of K-bytes remaining is set to 32767 then PCBoard
  considers this to be an "unlimited number" and that any bytes downloaded will
  not count against the limit.


  Note 3
  ------
  The "Upload/Sysop CHAT Credit Minutes" specifies a number of minutes that
  should be taken off from the current "time elapsed" for the caller thus
  extended his remaining number of minutes online for this session.

  DOOR programs may adjust this field if time credit was added or removed while
  the user was in the DOOR prior to returning to PCBoard.


  Note 4
  ------
  The "Language Extension" field specifies the extension to be added to
  filenames that PCBoard displays when the caller has chosen a language other
  than the default.  The default is all spaces (i.e.  " ") while if the caller
  has chosen a language such as French it may be set to ".FRE" for the
  extension.


  Note 5
  ------
  This field is provided only as a convenience to the DOOR programmer.  It
  specifies the number of minutes PCBoard has calculated to remain at the time
  the DOOR was opened or that the caller exited to DOS.  PCBoard does not read
  this field back in upon returning from the DOOR program.


  Note 6
  ------
  The final two conference fields are bit mapped just like the two fields at
  offsets 66 and 71 respectively.  One key difference with these, however, is
  that they apply only to conferences beyond conference #39 and that they are
  dynamically sized at the byte level.  Examples:

        High Conf Number    Extended Conferences    Dynamic Size
        ----------------    --------------------    ------------
             < 39                    0                   0
              40                     1                   1
              50                    11                   2
             100                    61                   8

  The formula for determine the dynamic size then is to take the high
  conference number and subtract 39 then divide by 8.  (i.e.  Size =
  (HighConf-39) / 8).


  Note 7
  ------
  The Event Active flag no longer directly reflects the setting in PCBOARD.DAT
  that specifies whether or not events are active.  The Event Flag for v15.0
  will be set to ON *only* if there is an event coming that might affect the
  current online caller's time.  Otherwise the Event Flag is set to OFF.

  Note 8
  ------
  The structure for this byte is as follows:

      Bit 0:  Used by PCBoard - reserved
      Bit 1:  Caller wants RIP Graphics
      Bit 2:  Caller wants to use his alias when in an alias supported conf.
      Bit 3:  Undefined - RESERVED - do NOT use
      Bit 4:  Undefined - RESERVED - do NOT use
      Bit 5:  Undefined - RESERVED - do NOT use
      Bit 6:  Undefined - RESERVED - do NOT use
      Bit 7:  Undefined - RESERVED - do NOT use

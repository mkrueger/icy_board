What is PCBoard?

PCBoard Bulletin Board Software allows your computer to operate as a 
communications host, known as a Bulletin Board System or BBS. With your 
BBS you can transfer information between two computers which may be 
connected via modem or Local Area Network (LAN) connection. 

In the beginning, bulletin board systems primarily exchanged messages.  
As bulletin board systems become more and more popular, the demand for 
more features increased.  Today, users logged into a BBS may read and 
write messages, transfer files, chat with other users online and more.  
PCBoard meets these and other user demands with several key features.  

PCBoard’s Key Features

PCBoard has many powerful features. The features listed below are but 
just a few of the features that PCBoard has. You will discover the other 
features as you read through the remainder of the manual and configure 
your BBS.

Quick Installation. The installation program will provide you with a 
basic setup in just minutes. Then from that base installation you can 
customize your system.

Powerful security features to restrict the information that you allow 
your users to see/transfer.

Customizable display files to make it easy for your users to find 
information and for you to give your BBS a unique look and feel.

Up to 65,535 conference areas. You can use conferences to focus on a 
particular subject or to isolate information or a group of users from 
the rest of  the BBS.

Extensive support for third party add-in software. You can draw upon the 
huge third party support that PCBoard has, to add door games, or run any 
DOS text mode application such as an informational  database. 

Multilingual support allows callers to choose which “language” the BBS 
prompts and display files will be displayed in.

Bulletins may be used to display ASCII documents or text files online.

Powerful boolean text searching capabilities. You can search messages, 
file descriptions, bulletins and more for simple or complex search 
strings using boolean operands such as AND, OR, and NOT. 

Multiasker aware. This allows the computer to be running other tasks 
when PCBoard does not immediately need the computers resources, or to 
run several nodes of PCBoard software on a single machine.

Works with any network which uses standard MS-DOS file/record locking 
procedures.

Grows to fit your needs. PCBoard can expand up to 32,768 nodes 
(concurrent users online) if you need additional nodes you simply 
purchase the appropriate software upgrade.

Optional command stacking. PCBoard allows you to stack commands on a 
single command line so expert users can quickly get to where they wish 
to go. Novice users are not ignored either. They may enter one command 
at a time and get the extra guidence to help them do what they wish to 
do.

Powerful serial port routines written in ‘C’ and assembly language for 
speed. Supports up to 8 standard COM ports and all 15 IRQ settings.  
There is also the option which allows you to use popular intelligent 
serial port boards or fossil drivers.

System Requirements

Below is a list of hardware and software that is necessary for a base 
configuration of PCBoard with one node.

Hardware

IBM (R) or compatible computer (8088, 8086, 80286, 80386, 80486, etc.)

Properly connected “AT command-set” modem for each dial-in node

384K of RAM

Software

PCBoard Software


NOTE:  If you plan on running multiple nodes please see the Multiple 
Nodes chapter of this manual.  This section has a list of required 
hardware and software for various system configurations.Technical 
Support

With a program as powerful  as PCBoard you may run into a situation 
where you cannot find an answer to one of your questions.  In such a 
case , you should first access online help (if possible) by pressing 1.  
If that fails to answer your question you should then search your manual 
to see if you can find the answer there.  If neither of these approaches 
brings you closer to a solution, you may want to consider contacting 
Clark Development for your support needs.

Clark Development Offers a trained technical support staff to answer 
your questions no matter how seemingly unimportant or complex.  Our 
technical support staff will be more than happy to help you with any 
problem related to the PCBoard program itself. Unfortunately, our 
technical support staff cannot help you with third-party add-ins or 
other programs not written by Clark Development.  If you have a question 
about another program your best solution  would be to contact the author 
of that program or to leave a message addressed to ALL on Salt Air where 
other, more experienced users may be able to assist you .

When Calling For Technical Support Via Phone:

Have your serial number ready

If possible, be at the computer you are experiencing the problem with.

Be prepared to describe, in detail,  the problem or question that you 
have, including the exact text of any error messages you may be getting.

If you have made attempts to correct the problem, be prepared to 
describe the actions taken to the technician.

When Requesting Technical Support Via BBS Message:

Describe the problem or question that you have in detail.

When necessary, try to use screen captures to enhance the readability of 
your message.

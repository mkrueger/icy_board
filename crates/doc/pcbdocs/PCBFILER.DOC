Adding New Files


PCBFiler is designed to help you maintain the file directories on your 
bulletin board system.  With PCBFiler, you can move/copy files between 
file directories and conferences.  In addition, you may also create 
complete file lists and even more.

Accessing PCBFiler

There are several ways to access PCBFiler.  Simply pick the method that 
corresponds to what you are doing at the time when you want to load 
PCBFiler.  The following describes the various ways you can load 
PCBFiler:

At a DOS prompt:  Because PCBFiler is an executable file, you can load 
it from the DOS command line by changing to a directory which has a 
PCBOARD.DAT file in it and typing PCBFILER on the command prompt.  The 
only way to pass command line parameters to PCBFiler is via the DOS 
command prompt.  See Command Line Parameters towards the end of this 
chapter for additional details. 

From the call-waiting screen:  Simply move the selection bar over to the 
box which shows PCBFiler and press ENTER.

While logged into PCBoard:  If you are logged in locally to PCBoard, you 
may press A-D to load PCBFiler.  If you are logged in locally using the 
/LOCALON command line switch for PCBoard, ALT-D will be disabled to 
prevent unauthorized users from accessing PCBFiler.

From System Manager:  From the Main Menu in System Manager, you can 
select Directory  Maintenance (PCBFILER) to load PCBFiler.

Explanation of PCBoard's File System

If you understand how PCBoard's file system works, it will be easier to 
setup your system to work the way you want it to work. The following is 
a brief explanation of all files that are relevant to your file 
directory system.

DIR:  This is the file that is displayed to users when they select F 
from your main menu to view the file directories on your system.  In 
essence, this is a text file which lists what each file directory on 
your system contains so users can select the file directory they wish to 
view.

DIR.LST:  This is the file PCBoard uses to determine where the file 
descriptions are stored, and the description for the directory contents.  
PCBFiler uses DIR.LST to determine where the files are stored on your 
hard drive or similar device. PCBFiler also determines what method to 
use when you sort your directories by reading DIR.LST.

DLPATH.LST is a file which contains a list of paths PCBoard will search 
through for files that a user requests to download.  Only the paths 
listed in this file are searched when a user requests a download.

There is no direct relation to downloading and the description of the 
files.  The descriptions for the files are merely a convenience to the 
user so they know what files are on your system.  

The PCBFiler Menu

When you load PCBFiler, you will be presented with the Main Menu.  From 
the Main Menu, you can edit directory files, configure the PCBFiler 
options, and perform other tasks related to maintaining file 
directories.  The following describes each menu option.

Edit DIR Files

This menu option enables you to edit the file directories on your 
system.  When you are editing your file directories, you can move, copy, 
or delete the files that are listed.  When you select this menu option, 
you are presented with the following choices:

Main Board Directories

This menu option will allow you to edit the file directories for the 
Main Board Conference (conference #0).  To edit the file directories of 
another conference, select Conference Directories instead of Main Board 
Directories.

From this point on, the screens are exactly the same as if you selected 
Conference Directories instead.  Therefore, see the following section 
for more information.

Conference Directories

If you have conferences in which files are available for download, this 
option will enable you to access these conferences.  You are shown a 
list of available conferences. After you select a conference, you will 
be presented with a new screen.

This new screen informs what the available directory numbers are for the 
current conference.  This information is determined by examining the 
DIR.LST file for each conference.  At any time, you can access the 
private directory which is directory 0 within PCBFiler.

Before you select a directory number to edit, you may press F2 to edit 
the DIR.LST file for the current conference.  When you do, the DIR.LST 
editor will be displayed on the screen.  You may change and save the 
information on this screen as you would in PCBSetup | Conferences.

You may notice that PCBFiler lists one more directory than you have 
defined in your DIR.LST file.  If you have answered N to the Make All 
Uploads Private, PCBoard will add your public upload directory as the 
last directory in the conference. If you have defined 14 directories in 
DIR.LST, your public upload directory will be listed as directory 15.

Once you select a directory to edit, you are shown some information 
about that directory.  The following is a sample:

Selected DIR Text File: C:\PCB\GEN\UPLOAD
Attached Subdirectory : C:\PCB\UPLOAD\
DIR File Description  : Main Board upload

Selected DIR Text File:  Displays the location of your description file.  
This is the file you entered in the DIR Text File Name & Path field in 
DIR.LST.

Attached Subdirectory:  This field should contain the disk directory 
where the majority of files are physically located for this file 
directory.  If you have not specified any subdirectory in your DIR.LST 
file, you are informed there is no attached subdirectory.

DIR File Description:  In DIR.LST you are given over 30 characters to 
describe the file directory.  For example, you may have entered 
something like Miscellaneous Screen Utilities. Whatever you entered in 
that field will be displayed here.

Next, you will be asked two questions.  The following describes
each question:

Include files found on DISK that are not listed in the DIR file:
There are two valid responses to this question.  The valid
responses are:

        N       Files which exist in the attached subdirectory but do 
                not have descriptions will not be listed in the editor.

        Y       All files in the attached subdirectory will be listed in 
                the editor.  The files which do not have descriptions 
                will have DSK or D next to each filename.

Verify file existence directory:  There are three valid responses to 
this question -- Y, N, and A.

        A       Verify all files in the directory listing to see if the 
                actual file exists in one of the directories listed in 
                DLPATH.LST.  Use this option if you want to check and 
                make sure a file is downloadable.  If the file is not 
                found in any of the directories listed in DLPATH.LST, 
                the editor will display notification to the right of the 
                filename.  Selecting this option will significantly 
                increase the time it takes to load the file into the 
                editor.

        N       Do not verify any of the files listed in the directory 
                listing.  This would be the choice to select if you want 
                to do some quick editing of a file directory and do not 
                care to check if the files actually exist on disk.

        Y       Verify all files listed in the directory listing to see 
                if they exist in the directory defined as the Attached 
                Subdirectory.  PCBFiler will report if the file actually 
                exists when you are in the editor.  Depending on how 
                many files you have in the file directory, it may 
                significantly increase the time it takes to load the 
                file into the directory editor.

Once you have answered the two questions, the directory file will be 
loaded and you will be placed in the directory editor. For instructions 
on how to use the directory editor, see the section titled The Directory 
Editor.

Off-Line Directories

If you select this option, you will be immediately taken into the 
directory editor and all of the files that are stored in your off-line 
directory will be displayed inside the editor. Since there is no 
description file associated with the off-line file directory, you will 
not see any descriptions.  See The Directory Editor and Maintaining 
Files for additional information.

Undo last change

Whenever you perform operations in the directory editor (e.g., moving or 
copying these files), PCBoard will record the changes made in case you 
wish to undo them.  Only one level of undo is maintained.  If you wish 
to undo the most recent changes, select this menu option.

If you moved files, PCBoard will move the descriptions and files back to 
the original directories.  If you copied files, the copies of the file 
and description that were made will be deleted.  However, if you deleted 
files, PCBoard does not undelete the file but it will restore the file 
description.

Sort all DIR Files

Allows you to sort file directories in all conferences using the sort 
method specified in DIR.LST and in the conference configuration (for the 
upload directories).  Once you select this option,  you are asked if you 
wish to only sort the upload directories in each conference.  If you 
choose to select only the upload directories, both the private and 
public upload directories for each conference will be sorted (if they 
exist).  

Create Files List

If you want to compile a list of all files available in a particular 
conference, use this menu option.  PCBFiler will create a file called 
PCBFILES.LST.  This file will contain a compilation of all of the 
directories in the conferences you defined in the PCBFiler Defaults menu 
option.

PCBFiler will put a header before each file directory so your 
directories can be easily distinguished.  The header has the following 
format:

[Conf_Name]: [Directory_Number]) [Directory_Description]
========================================================

where [Conf_Name] is the name of the conference,
[Directory_Number] is the number of the file directory and
[Directory_Description] is the description of the file directory.

For example, you may see the following in your PCBFILES.LST file:

Main Board: 1) Sample Files
====================================

SAMPLE1.FIL    168046  12-28-90  Filename and description holder
SAMPLE2.FIL      2662  12-10-92  No description available
TEST3.TXT        2839  04-01-92  No description available (yet)

Because your description files support @X color codes and included files 
(%filename), PCBFiler must take these into consideration.  When you 
create a file list using this menu option, PCBFiler will strip all @X 
color codes in the description file, and will automatically include any 
files pointed to by %filename.

Scan for Duplicate/Missing Files

Periodically you may want to scan your file system for duplicate or 
missing files.  This menu option will print a comprehensive report to a 
file called ANALYSIS.RPT in the default directory. You can use this 
report to help fix problems in your setup or to eliminate redundancy.  
The duplicate/missing report contains the following information:

Conferences Included in Scan:  As a reminder, this will list all 
conferences you have told PCBFiler to include in the missing/duplicate 
scan.  This can be changed in PCBFiler | Defaults Page 2.

Disk directories scanned:  Lists the disk directories that were scanned 
for duplicates or missing files.  This information is obtained from 
DLPATH.LST in each conference scanned.

DIR files scanned:  Lists the directory description files (sometimes 
called DIR files) that were scanned for duplicates or missing files.  
This information is obtained from the DIR.LST file in each conference.

Files listed in DIR files but missing from Disk:  The files listed in 
this section were listed in a directory description file, but when the 
entries in DLPATH.LST were scanned, the corresponding file could not be 
found on disk.  This means the file is not available for download.

Duplicate Files found in Disk subdirectories:  The files listed in this 
section were found in more than one subdirectory.  To determine this 
information, PCBFiler scans the DLPATH.LST file for all conferences.  If 
the file is available in more than one subdirectory, it is considered to 
be a duplicate.

Duplicate Files found in DIR files:  If a file has descriptions in more 
than one directory, it will be listed in this section of the report.  
You will be shown what directory numbers each description number is in 
so you may fix the problem if necessary.

Locate File Spec on Disk

This menu selection is almost identical to the L user command that can 
be used to search for filenames which match a particular filename or 
wildcard.  PCBoard will not search the file directories.  Instead, it 
will search the download paths in all conferences to look for matching 
files.    This menu option is useful if you are looking for a file you 
think might be available for download but are not sure where it can be 
found on your system.

The following lists the fundamental differences between this menu 
option, and the L user command.

PCBFiler searches the disk instead of the description files.

All conferences are searched

PCBFiler searches through all subdirectories listed in the DLPATH.LST 
for each conference to find  a match.

When you select this menu option, you are asked for the filename or 
filespec you would like to search for.  You may enter any valid filename 
(including wildcards).  Once you have entered the filename to search 
for, PCBFiler will begin scanning all conferences for matches. If a 
match is found, you will be shown the drive, path, and filename to help 
you locate the file on disk faster.

Notice how the scan begins with the Main Board conference.  Any matches 
will show the complete path and filename where the file can be found.  
Files will be listed even if they do not have descriptions written for 
them.  If you want to see only files with descriptions, use the Locate 
File Spec in DIR Files menu option instead.

Locate File Spec in DIR Files

If you select this menu option, you will be asked what filename you 
would like to search the directory description files for. To help find 
multiple files, you may specify wildcards. PCBFiler will scan all 
directory description files in all conferences for a match.  If a match 
is found, the description will be displayed on the screen as shown in 
the following example:

The scan begins in the first file directory of conference 0 (the Main 
Board) and proceeds to scan all file directories in all conferences.  
Any matching files will show the complete file description including the 
date, file size, and filename.

Locate Text in DIR Files

If you wish to search the descriptions of all files in all conferences, 
select this menu option.  You will be asked for the text to search for.  
Once you type in the text to search for, PCBFiler will begin searching 
all files in all conferences for the text you entered.

As with just about any other text searching function associated with 
PCBoard, you can specify Boolean operators to help narrow your search.

Notice that the description for CALGUIDE.ZIP contains the word HELP on 
the fourth line of the description.  Since all file directories were 
being scanned for the word HELP and this particular description has the 
word help, the entire file description is displayed.

Edit PCBFiler Defaults Page 1

There are numerous options you can configure to help you control how 
PCBFiler operates.  There are two menu options (Defaults Page 1 and 
Default Page 2).  This section describes each of the options available 
in  Page 1 of the defaults.

Maximum number of lines allowed in DIR file editor

This field controls how many lines you can load into the Directory 
Editor.  You should enter a value high enough so you can load any of 
your file directories into the Directory Editor. If you specify a value 
which is too low for your system, you may see a message stating Error: 
reached maximum number of records.  If you see this error, increase the 
value of this field.

While you can enter any value up to 32000 in this field, you should keep 
the value relatively close to the size of your largest directory because 
you may be wasting un-necessary memory by specifying a very large 
number.


NOTE:  If PCBFiler runs out of conventional memory while loading a file 
directory into memory, it will attempt to use virtual memory on your 
hard disk which may slow down your load time slightly.

Include files found on DISK that are not listed in the DIR file

This option enables you to control what the default will be for the 
Include files found on DISK question.  The following are valid defaults:

N               Do not include any files which do not have descriptions 
                into the Directory Editor.

Y               Include files found in the attached subdirectory 
                (contained in DIR.LST) which do not have descriptions 
                yet.  This option is extremely useful for adding new 
                files to the system.

Verify file existence

When loading files into the directory editor, you can have PCBFiler 
verify that a file really exists on one of the drives in your system.  
The following are the valid options for this field:

A               Verify file existence by searching all entries in the 
                DLPATH.LST for the current conference.  This is 
                extremely useful if you have a file directory which has 
                files in two or more different subdirectories.  For 
                example, you may have some of the files stored on a hard 
                drive and the rest of the files stored on a CD-ROM.  If 
                both paths are listed in your DLPATH.LST file, the files 
                will be verified properly.  Basically, if the file is 
                available for download, it will be verified properly.

N               Do not verify file existence.  This will reduce the 
                amount of time it takes to load the file into the 
                Directory Editor because PCBFiler does not have to check 
                and see if each file listed really exists.

Y               Verify file existence, but only verify using the 
                attached subdirectory listed in the DIR.LST file.

If you use either the Y or A option when loading a directory into the 
editor, you will see the status of the file existence to the left of 
each filename when in the editor.  The following are keywords that you 
may see:

[blank] If the file could be found, you will not see any status codes.

DIR     If there is a description for a file, but the corresponding file 
        could not be found, you will see DIR next to the file name if 
        you are using novice mode in the editor.  If you are using 
        expert mode in the editor, you will see an L to the left of the 
        filename instead.

NOTE:  If you choose to verify file existence, the file date and file 
size will be updated when the file is loaded into the editor.  The file 
date will be updated only when the Update FILE DATE with date found on 
disk file option is enabled.

Perform operation (Move/Rename/Delete) on marked files

If you have made changes while in the Directory Editor, you will be 
asked if you want to perform the file operations (Move/Rename/Delete).  
The valid options are as follows:

A               PCBFiler will search for the entries in the DLPATH.LST 
                for the current conference to see if the file exists.  
                If it exists, it will be moved, copied, or deleted as 
                specified in the directory editor.

N               If you select this option, only the descriptions of the 
                files that have been marked to be copied, moved, or 
                deleted, will be processed.  This means the physical 
                files on disk will remain untouched.

Y               If you select this option, both the files and the file 
                descriptions will be processed as specified in the 
                directory editor.

Check for duplicate files in each text DIR listing processed

After all of the changes have been made as specified in the directory 
editor, you can have PCBFiler check all of the processed directories to 
see if there are any duplicates in any one file directory.  The 
following are the valid options for this field:


N               Do not check for duplicates after all files have been 
                processed.  In all likelihood, you will not need to 
                check for duplicates each time you make changes to a 
                directory.  However, it is recommended that you do check 
                for duplicates from time to time.

Y               Defaults to check for duplicates each time changes are 
                made to file directories.  If duplicates are found, you 
                are shown the duplicates and asked which description (if 
                any) you would like to delete from the file directory.

Perform DIR processing in NON-STOP mode (no pause when screen full)

When PCBFiler is processing the changes you made, it outputs what it is 
currently doing to the screen.  You can control whether or not PCBFiler 
should pause after each screen of data is displayed on your screen.  The 
following are the valid options for this field:


N               If you select this option, PCBFiler will pause after 
                each screen of data is displayed on your screen.  Each 
                time PCBFiler pauses, you are given the option to go 
                into continuous or non-stop mode by pressing C at the 
                prompt.

Y               Process the files in non-stop or continuous mode.  
                PCBFiler will not pause each time the screen fills up.

Delete tagged files from disk

If you have selected any files to be deleted from a file directory, 
during processing you may be asked if you actually wish to delete the 
files from disk.  The following are the valid defaults for this field:

A               If you select this default, the files will always be 
                deleted from disk.  In fact, you are never even asked if 
                you want to delete the files--PCBFiler will do it 
                automatically.

N               Default to not delete the files from disk.  If you 
                answer N to the Delete tagged files from disk, the 
                descriptions will still be deleted, but the files will 
                still remain on disk.  This means you only removed the 
                description from the file directory.

Y               Default to delete any files that have been marked for 
                deletion in the directory editor.  This means both the 
                file description and the file itself will be deleted 
                from the file directory.

Update FILE DATE with date found on disk file

If you have chosen to verify file existence when loading a file into the 
directory editor, you may also choose to have the file date updated to 
the date found on disk or leave the date unchanged.  The following are 
the valid defaults for this option:


N               Do not update the description to reflect the current 
                file date found on disk.  The date that listed in the 
                description will remain as the date for the file.

Y               Update the file date listed in the description for the 
                file to reflect the date of the file on disk.  If a file 
                gets updated frequently or ever changes file dates, you 
                may want to have it reflect the current date.  If so, 
                select this as the default.

Set FILE DATE to today when moving/copying files

This option allows you to choose if you want to set the file date in the 
description to the current date when moving or copying files.  The 
following are valid defaults for this field:



A               Ask each time files are processed.  By defaulting to 
                ask, you can choose to set the file dates of all files 
                being moved or copied to the current date.

N               Always leave the file date as listed in the Directory 
                Editor when moving or copying files.

Y               Always change the file date to the current date of any 
                file being moved or copied.

Create 0-byte file when moving OFF-LINE or creating DELETED entries

This option allows you to control if a zero-byte file is left behind 
when a file is removed from the file directory (using F7 in the Directory 
Editor) or moved to the OFF-LINE directory. The following are the valid 
defaults for this field:

N               A zero-byte file will not be left in the directory where 
                the file used to reside.  This means a user can 
                re-upload the file to the system because the file will 
                no longer exist on the system.

Y               A zero-byte file with the same name will be left in the 
                directory where it used to reside.  This will help 
                prevent users from uploading a file with the same name 
                as the one just deleted because technically, the file 
                still exists on the system.

Default to Expert Mode inside DIR File Editor

There are two modes of operation in the Directory Editor--novice and 
expert.  You can choose which method you prefer to default to when using 
the Directory Editor.  The following are the valid defaults:



N               Defaults to novice mode when you load the Directory 
                Editor. This means you will see more meaningful status 
                indicators if you choose to verify file existence.  For 
                example, expert mode will show a D next to the left of a 
                filename if it exists on disk but has no description.  
                In novice mode, PCBFiler will print DSK instead.

Y               Defaults to expert mode when using the Directory Editor. 
                When in expert mode, you will see a shortened status 
                indicator, conference number, and directory number to 
                the left of each filename.  Expert mode is very useful 
                when you are moving a large quanity of files to many 
                different subdirectories because you can quickly change 
                the directory number or conference number where the file 
                will be moved.  You can do all of this without having to 
                select the file and then pressing ALT-M to move the file.

NOTE:  You can toggle between expert and novice modes while in the 
Directory Editor by pressing ALT-X.

Default indentation for vertical bar on Secondary Lines

When you are inserting secondary lines in the Directory Editor, you can 
control what position the secondary line character ( | ) will be placed.  
You may enter any value between 2 and 79.  You may not enter a 1 because 
PCBoard requires that there be a space preceding the secondary line 
character.  To match the 45 character lines PCBoard uses, enter a 
default indentation of 32. Speaking of PCBoard, this option will not 
change the 45 character limit per description line that the user enters.

Edit PCBFiler Defaults Page 2

Like Defaults Page 1, this screen allows you to change options that will 
affect the operation of PCBFiler.  The following describes each of the 
fields available via this menu option.

Include Conferences in File List

This field holds the conferences you want to include whenever you create 
a file list from either the main menu in PCBFiler or with the /LIST 
command line parameter.  You may specify a single conference, a range of 
conferences, or a combination of the two in this field.  For example, if 
you want to include conference 0 (Main Board), conferences 10-15, and 
conference 22 in your file lists, enter the following in this field:

0,10-15,22

Include for Missing/Dupe Scan

In this field, specify the conferences you want to include in the 
missing/dupe scan that you can select from the Main Menu. Like the 
previous field, you can specify a single conference, a range of 
conferences, or a combination of the two.

Maximum number of files allowed in scan

The number you choose here should be high enough to handle the total 
number of files listed in all directory files plus the total of all of 
the files on disk.  (maximum number is 65,000)

The scan for duplicate/missing files feature stores the names and 
locations of all files in DIRs and hard disks in virtual memory to speed 
the sorting and comparison process.  Therefore, if you select a number 
which is too high for your system, you may end up using the virtual 
memory much faster than you need to which will slow down the 
duplicate/missing report.

Off-line directory

In this field, specify the drive and subdirectory where you want to 
store files you have marked as being moved off-line. PCBFiler will copy 
the files to the location specified in this field and mark the file as 
being off-line in the file description.

If you are really moving the files off-line, you may want to specify the 
location of a DOS device which supports removable media (e.g., floppy 
disk drive, magneto-optical drive, etc.). If you move files to a 
location which has removable media, you can fill up one disk or 
cartridge, store it, then put in a new one and move some more files 
off-line.

Backup directory

When PCBFiler processes files, it makes backups of all directory files 
it modifies in case you choose to undo the changes made. This field 
enables you to specify where the backup files will be created.  In this 
field, specify the drive and subdirectory where you want your backup 
files to be created.  If you leave this field blank, the backup files 
will be created in the default or current subdirectory.

Original Directory

Some SysOps may copy their directory files to RAM disks when they boot 
their system while the masters are stored on a hard-drive or other fixed 
media device.  If you use this type of setup, PCBFiler can help you make 
all of your changes to the physical copies of your DIR files stored on 
the hard-drive.  

In this field, enter the name of the directory you would like to 
translate to a new location.  For example, you may physically store your 
directory files in C:\PCB\GEN\ but you may copy them out to F:\, a ram 
drive, for quicker access.  If this resembles your setup, enter F:\ in 
this field.  The F:\ will be replaced with whatever you enter in the New 
Directory field.

NOTE:  If you do not intend to use this feature, you must leave
this field blank.

New Directory

If a file directory is found which includes the path specified in the 
Original Directory field, the original directory will be replaced with 
your entry in this field.  If your system resembled the previous 
example, enter C:\PCB\GEN in this field.

File VIEWERS

When you are in the Directory Editor, you have the ability to view the 
currently highlighted file by pressing ALT-V.  In this section you may 
specify up to six viewable extensions.  Each viewable extension can 
execute a program or batch file which may then allow you to view the 
file while in the Directory Editor.

In the File Extension field, enter the viewable extension.  In the DOS 
Command field, enter the DOS command whenever you press ALT-V in the 
Directory Editor while a filename with this particular extension is 
highlighted.  PCBFiler will run the command you specify after it appends 
the filename you are currently viewing onto the command.  For example, 
if you enter EDIT in this field and you press ALT-V while viewing a file 
called TESTRUN.TXT that is stored in  C:\PCB\DL01\, PCBFiler will 
execute the following command:

EDIT C:\PCB\DL01\TESTRUN.TXT.

PCBFiler will begin scanning the file extensions in the File VIEWERS 
block from the top down to the bottom acting upon the first match found.  
There is a special extension you may specify which will match on every 
extension.  If you want to take advantage of this, make this new entry 
your last file extension. The extension you want to enter is ???.  The 
question marks are wildcard characters which will match any filename 
extension. What type of viewing utility should you use for this entry? 
Most SysOps will use a all-purpose viewing utility which will simply 
show the raw content of the file.


The following is a sample setup.

File Extension : ZIP      DOS Command : PCBFV C:\PCBFV\PCBFV.CNF /L
File Extension : ARJ      DOS Command : PCBFV C:\PCBFV\PCBFV.CNF /L
File Extension : ARC      DOS Command : INTERNAL
File Extension : ???      DOS Command : LIST


If a filename is viewed which has an extension of ZIP or ARJ, PCBFiler 
will execute PCBFV C:\PCBFV\PCBFV.CNF /L [filename]. If a filename is 
viewed which has an extension of ARC, PCBFiler will use its internal 
viewer for ARC compressed files.  Any other files will get viewed 
(because of the ??? extension) and will be viewed using a utility called 
LIST.


NOTE:  PCBFiler has two internal viewers.  One internal viewer is for 
ARC compressed files and the other is for ZIP compressed files.  These 
internal viewers simply list the files stored in the compressed file and 
their sizes.  To use these internal viewers, specify INTERNAL in the DOS 
Command field.

Choose PCBoard DIR File Colors

PCBoard will colorize your file directories on the fly.  You can 
colorize the following elements of your directory files:


Header or banner at the top of a directory file
Filename
File size
File date
First line of a description
Any additional lines of a description
Text lines in the middles of a directory file
OFF-LINE notices (in the date field)
DELETED notices (in the date field)

To choose your colors, simply move the cursor on the sample screen to 
the color or section you want to change and press ENTER. When you press 
ENTER, you are presented with a box which shows all possible color 
selections you may choose.  Move the cursor around in the box until you 
have found the color you wish to use.  Once you press ENTER on the color 
you wish to use, you will see the sample screen update to show you what 
your directories will look like.

When you are done making all of your selections, press ESC to exit.  If 
you have made any changes, you will be prompted if you wish to save the 
changes.  To save the changes, answer Y to this question.

The Directory Editor

The Directory is the heart and soul of PCBFiler.  Within the editor, you 
can easily maintain your file directories by moving, copying, or 
deleting files located in a particular directory. Once you understand 
how the directory editor works, you will be able to quickly and easily 
place files where you want them.

The Directory Editor Screen

Understanding the Directory Editor screen will help you be more 
productive while using it.  The following screen shows points of 
interest.  Following the screen, an explanation will be given which 
describe what each arrow points to.

status indicators:  The status indicators are always displayed but are 
different for novice and expert users.  These status indicators are 
typically shown in bright red on the left side of the screen.  The 
following explains each status indicator and what it looks like in both 
novice and expert modes.

Status Codes 	 	Detailed Description 

Novice 	Expert 	 

  DIR     L     There is a description for this file.  However, the 
                actual file could not be found on disk.  PCBFiler will 
                either check the attached directory as defined in 
                DIR.LST or for all paths listed in DLPATH.LST depending 
                on how you choose to verify existence. 
 
  DSK     D     This file was found on disk, but does not have a 
                description yet.  You must enter a description for this 
                file if you want it listed in the file directories. 



Action Codes 	 	Detailed Description 


Novice  Expert   

CPY 	C 	The file and description are marked for copying. 

DEL 	D 	The file and description are marked for deletion. 

MOV 	M 	The file and description are marked for moving. 

REM 	R 	The description will be deleted, leaving a 0-byte file. 

SEL     S       The file has been selected.  You can move all files that 
                are selected, by pressing ALT-M while you have files 
                selected.  All selected files will be moved. 


current line number:  Represents the current line number that is 
highlighted in the directory file.  These line numbers include all 
description lines, text lines, blank lines, etc.

lines in directory:  The total number of lines that are in the file 
directory currently loaded into the editor.

primary description line:  Every file must have a description if you 
want the file to be listed in your file directories.  The first line of 
the description is known as the primary description line because it is 
required.

secondary description line:  A secondary description line is any line in 
a multi-line description other than the first line. This line always has 
a vertical bar ( | ) to help separate it from a primary description 
line.  When the file is listed in the file directory, the vertical bar 
will not be shown to the user.

text line:  Any line in a file directory which does not describe a file, 
is considered a text line.  You have 79 characters on a text line which 
you can enter text.  The previous example points to a text line that 
says %H:\PCB\DIR\H_PCBD2.  The % in the first column is a special 
feature of PCBoard and PCBFiler.  In this case, PCBFiler will display 
the H:\PCB\DIR\H_PCBD2.

conference number:  The conference number is only displayed when you are 
using expert mode in the editor.  If you change the value in this field, 
the file will be automatically marked for moving to the new conference 
you specify.

directory number:  Like the conference number, the directory number is 
only displayed while you are using expert mode in the editor.  If you 
change the value in this field, the file will be moved to the new 
directory you specify.  If you want to move the file to the off-line 
directory, you can enter an X for the directory number.

Navigating In The Editor

There are some keystrokes you will want to remember to help you navigate 
while you are in the Directory Editor.  These keys will easily let you 
go to the beginning or end of a directory file. In addition, you can use 
these keystrokes to step through fields in the editor.

You can tell what the current field is, because it will be highlighted.  
For example, if the date field is the current field, you can enter any 
valid date into the field and it will be saved.  Likewise, you can move 
over to the description area, and enter or change text in that field.

Keystroke 	Description of action 
--------   ---------------------------------------------------------
up        Move to the field above the currently highlighted field. 

down      Move to the field below the currently highlighted field. 

left      Move the cursor one character to the right in the current field. 

right     Move the cursor one character to the left in the current field. 

TAB       Move to the next field. 

SHIFT-TAB Move to the previous field. 

Home      Move the cursor to the beginning of the current field. 

End       Move the cursor to the end of the current field. 

up        Display the previous 15 lines (page) of the file directory. 

down      Display the next 15 lines (page) of the file directory. 

CTRL-End  Delete everything from the cursor to the end of the field. 

CTRL-up   If you press this once, PCBFiler will move to the first field 
          on the current screen.  If you press this keystroke twice 
          (quickly), you will be placed at the beginning of the file 
          directory. 

CTRL-down If you press this once, PCBFiler will move to the last field 
          on the current screen.  If you press this keystroke twice 
          (quickly), you will be placed at the end or last field of the 
          file directory. 



Commands Available

Within PCBFiler there are several commands you can execute which
will allow you to perform actions on various files, check free
space, shell to DOS, etc.  The following is a list of commands
available while you are in the Directory Editor of PCBFiler:


Key       Description 
-------   --------------------------------------------------------
 ESC      Exit the Directory Editor.  When you are done making changes, 
          press this key to exit the editor.  If you have made changes, 
          you will be prompted if you would like to save the changes you 
          have made.  You can choose to save the changes, abort the 
          changes, or return to the editor. 

 F1       Access on-line help.  On-line context sensitive help is 
          available from just about anywhere in PCBFiler.  To access 
          this on-line help, press F1. 

 F2       Display file directory setup.  Sometimes you may need to view 
          the directory setup for a particular conference so you know 
          what directory you want to move or copy a file to.  When you 
          press F2 you are asked for the conference you want to view the 
          directory setup of. 

 F3       Convert to upper-case.  All alphabetical characters in the 
          current field will be converted to upper-case letters.  
          Numbers are not effected. 

 F4       Convert to lower-case.  All alphabetical characters in the 
          current field will be converted to lower-case letters.  
          Numbers are not effected. 

 F5       Convert file listing to text line.  Normally, PCBFiler will 
          split-up a file description into various fields (filename, 
          date, size, etc.).  You can tell PCBoard to convert the 
          current file description into a text line using this command. 

 F6       Convert text line to file listing.  If a text line is in the 
          proper format for a file description (see The File Directory 
          Format), the text line will be changed back so you can access 
          one field at a time rather than the entire line. 

 F7       Remove file.  Marks the current filename to be removed. When 
          the file is removed, the file description remains but the date 
          changes to show that the file was deleted.  A zero byte file 
          is also usually left (Depending on Defaults Page 1) where the 
          file used to be so the file cannot be uploaded again. 

 F8       Copy file.  After you have marked a filename to be moved, you 
          can change it so the file is copied instead of moved.  This 
          means both the file and the description will be left in the 
          current directory and also copied to the destination 
          directory. 

 F9       Delete file.  The current filename is marked for deletion. 
          This means both the file on disk and the file description will 
          be permanently deleted from this file directory. 

 F10      Undo line.  If you have made changes to a field, you can undo 
          those changes while you are still in the field by pressing 
          F10.  Any changes you have made will be lost. 

 ALT-A    Repeat last command.  There are certain commands you may want 
          to repeat frequently.  For example, you may use ALT-L and 
          ALT-Z several times to find the right file.  To make things 
          easier, PCBFiler will repeat the last search when you press 
          ALT-A. 

 ALT-D    Delete current line.  The current line will be deleted from 
          the directory editor.  It does not matter if the line is a 
          text line or a file description.  The deletion cannot be 
          undone while in the editor. 

 ALT-F    Check free drive space.  When you are moving files around it 
          may become essential to see how much space you have available 
          on a system drive.  When you issue this command, you are asked 
          for the drive letter you wish to see the free-space for.  Once 
          you enter a valid drive letter, you are shown the total space 
          available on the drive and the amount of free space on the 
          drive. 

 ALT-I    Insert a line.  Somewhere down the road, you may need to 
          insert a line in your file directory.  PCBFiler allows you to 
          enter three different types of lines.  If you select the first 
          type, a totally blank line will be inserted.  If you pick 
          option B, a line will be inserted showing you the fields in a 
          file description.  Finally, if you choose the default (option 
          C), a secondary description line will be entered.  This is 
          most useful when you are adding a new line to a description. 

 ALT-L    Locate a filename.  When you are working with several files, 
          you may need to locate a particular filename.  This command 
          allows you to find a specific filename.  You may enter a 
          filename to search for or you may enter any valid wildcards.  
          If a match is found, the highlight bar will be moved to the 
          match. 

 ALT-M    Move a file.  If your highlight bar is currently on a file 
          description, you can mark the file to be moved to another 
          directory.  You are prompted for the conference number, and 
          directory number you want to move the file to.  You are also 
          asked if you wish to copy the file instead.  See Moving or 
          Deleting Files. 

 ALT-O    Shell to DOS.  Nothing is more handy than being able to shell 
          to DOS when you need to.  You can shell to DOS at any time 
          while you are in the Directory Editor by pressing ALT-O. 

 ALT-S    Select current file.  When your highlight bar is on a file 
          description, the current file will be marked as a selected 
          file.  You can use ALT-M to move all selected files to a new 
          directory.  This is very handy if you are moving lots of files 
          and do not want to press ALT-M on each file description. 

 ALT-T    Change file date to today's date.  The date of the current 
          filename will be changed to today's date. 

 ALT-V    View current file.  PCBFiler will view the currently 
          highlighted filename using the programs you defined in 
          Defaults Page 2. 

 ALT-X    Toggle expert/novice mode.  As mentioned previously, there are 
          two different modes of operation within the Directory 
          Editor--novice and expert.  You can toggle novice and expert 
          mode using this command. 

 ALT-Z    Search for text.  Like the (Z)ippy command in PCBoard, you can 
          use this command to search for text in a description.  If a 
          match is found, the highlight bar will be moved to the 
          matching filename. 

Moving or Deleting Files

An integral part of the file system is the ability to move and delete 
files.  Most SysOps will have several file directories defined.  Since 
all uploads go into one directory, you need a way to move files out of 
the upload directory into a new directory.  Likewise, you may need to 
delete a file because you do not want to put it online for download and 
you do not want it wasting space.

Moving Files To Another Directory

There are two different ways to move files within the Directory Editor.  
Each method has advantages and disadvantages.  The following discusses 
the two methods:

        ALT-M      If you press ALT-M while your highlight bar is on a 
                   valid file description, you will see a box pop up. 
                   This box asks you the following information:

Conference Number: The conference number to move the file to.
Directory Number:  The file directory to move the file to.
Move or Copy (M/C):  Enter M to move or C to copy the file.
Move File Offline:  Enter Y if you wish to move the file off-line.


Simply fill in this information, and press ESC to mark the file for 
moving.  You will see either a MOV or an M next to the filename showing 
you that the filename is marked to be moved.


If you press ALT-M while you have files that are marked as selected (SEL 
or S) all files that were selected will be moved to the location you 
specify and the files will be unmarked.

        Expert  While you are in expert mode in the Directory Editor you 
                can change the number located in either the conference 
                or directory number field.  If a new number is specified 
                in either of those fields, you will notice that the file 
                will be marked for moving.

Using this method can save you time because you never have to hit ALT-M 
and you do not have to select files.  Another advantage is that you can 
see the conference and file directory the files are designated to be 
moved to.

Moving Files Off-Line

Just as there are two ways to move a file, there are two ways to move a 
file to the off-line file directory.  When you press ALT-M you will 
notice there is a prompt asking you if you want to move the file 
off-line.  If you answer Y, the file will be moved to the off-line file 
directory and a zero-byte file will be left behind to prevent the 
filename from being uploaded again.

In expert mode, you can simply put an X in the conference column.  You  
will immediately notice the file is marked for moving.  The file will be 
moved to the directory that you specified as the off-line directory and 
the date in the description will be changed to say OFF-LINE.

Deleting Files

You may either delete a file or remove a file from a file directory.  
The following describes the difference between deleting and removing a 
file:

Deleting:  Both the file description and the file will be marked for 
deletion.  This is the method that you will want to use if you want to 
totally purge a file from the system.

Removing:  Only the physical file is deleted leaving the file 
description behind.  To help differentiate a normal file from a file 
which has been removed, the date in the file description will be changed 
to DELETED.  In addition, a zero-byte file is left behind on disk to 
prevent a file with the same name from being uploaded again.

Changing a Filename, Date or Description

Changing a filename, date or description is extremely easy.  All you 
have to do is move your highlighting bar to one of the fields mentioned 
previously and simply type in the new filename, date or description.  
When you exit the Directory Editor, your changes will be made to both 
the file description and the physical file on disk.

Multi-line descriptions

Obviously it would be quite difficult to describe a file with only 45 
characters.  PCBoard and PCBFiler allow you to enter up to 65 lines for 
your file descriptions.  To add a description line to an existing file 
description you insert a new line using ALT-I.  Insert a secondary 
description line and start typing.  If you need another line, simply 
press ALT-I again to insert another secondary description line.

Make sure whenever you are entering a description and it is not the 
first line that it has a | character before the place where your 
description begins.  Otherwise, your description line will be treated as 
a text line instead of a description line.

Processing changes made in directory files

Once you have made all of the changes you want to make in the directory 
editor, you need to actually carry out those changes. To do this,  press 
E to exit the Directory Editor and save your changes.

At this point you will be asked some questions regarding processing.

Perform operation (Move/Rename/Delete) on marked files

PCBFiler allows you to control if the physical files will be processed 
in addition to the file descriptions.  In most situations, you will want 
to move the physical files with their descriptions.  The following are 
the valid responses to this question.

        A       PCBFiler will search for the entries in the DLPATH.LST 
                for the current conference to see if the file exists.  
                If it exists, it will be moved, copied, or deleted as 
                you specified in the directory editor.

        N       If you select this option, any files which have been 
                marked to be copied, moved, or deleted, will have only 
                the description acted upon.  The physical file will 
                remain untouched.

        Y       If you select this option then both the files (on disk) 
                and the file description will be processed as you have 
                specified in the directory editor.

Check for duplicate files in each text DIR listing processed

After all of the changes have been made as specified in the directory 
editor, you can have PCBFiler check all of the directories that were 
processed to see if there are any duplicates in any one file directory.  
The following are the valid responses for this field:

        N       Do not check for duplicates after all files have been 
                processed.  In all likelihood, you will not need to 
                check for duplicates each time you make changes to a 
                directory.  However, it is recommended that you do check 
                for duplicates from time to time.

        Y       Defaults to check for duplicates each time changes are 
                made to file directories.  If duplicates are found, you 
                are shown the duplicates and asked which description (if 
                any) you would like to delete from the file directory.

Set FILE DATE to today's date when moving/copying files

This question will only appear if you set the default of this field to 
A.  This option allows you to choose if you wish to set the file date in 
the description to the current date when moving or copying files.  The 
following are valid responses.


        N       Always leave the file date as listed in the Directory 
                Editor when moving or copying files.

        Y       Always change the file date to the current date of any 
                file that is being moved or copied.

Processing The Files

Once you have answered all of the questions, PCBFiler will begin 
processing each of the file directories that are involved.  A single 
line will be displayed showing what is currently being processed.  For 
example, you may see the following:


Backing up: H:\UTIL\FDIR2
Changed   : HISTRY14.ZIP file date
Moved File: HISTRY14.ZIP to Area 9, DIR 8
Sorting   : H:\DOOR\UPLOAD by Date (Ascending)


From the first line you can see that PCBFiler backed up the directory 
file in case you wish to undo the changes.  Next, the file date on 
HISTRY14.ZIP was changed to reflect the new date that was entered in the 
editor.  Finally, the file was moved to conference 9, file directory 8 
and the destination file directory was sorted using the method specified 
in DIR.LST.

Sharing Violations

As your system becomes larger there is a better chance you will start to 
see sharing violations.  These are notifications that the current action 
could not be processed yet, because someone is accessing the file that 
is needed for processing.  These errors are common in a multinode 
environment and are normal.

Whenever PCBFiler runs into a sharing violation, it will wait 10 seconds 
and try to access the file again.  The best way to avoid or minimize the 
number of sharing violations you get while processing files is to do 
your directory maintenance in off-peak hours when fewer people are 
online.

The File Directory Format

PCBoard stores the file directories in ASCII format.  In other words, 
you can look at your file directories with a text editor and see exactly 
what they look like.  Because the file directories are stored in ASCII 
format, the text must be placed in certain positions and follow certain 
rules in order to be considered valid.

If you do not manually edit your file directory listings, you most 
likely will not need to pay attention to this section. Those that 
manually edit their file directories will find this section full of 
useful information.

Text lines:  Any line that is not part of a file description is 
considered a text line.  Obviously, there is no format required for a 
text line.  Simply enter up to 78 characters per line and it will be 
displayed as entered.  You can use text lines at the top of your file 
directory as a header which will describe the contents of a file 
directory.  There is no real limit to what you can do with text lines.  
Remember that even text lines get sorted if you have chosen to sort the 
file directory.

In the previous screen capture the text lines are the dashed lines 
explaining the directory, and the box. 

Include files:  An included file is a line which begins with a % 
followed by a valid filename.  The file specified will be viewed at the 
point it is stored in the directory file.  The include file feature is 
very handy to use especially if you have a disclaimer that you put in 
each file directory.  That way, you may only have to enter something 
like %C:\PCB\GEN\DISCLAIM on a blank line instead of all of the text.  
When you make a change to the DISCLAIM file the changes are 
automatically spread through all directories which display the file.

Primary description line:  This is the line that contains the filename, 
date, size, and first line of the description.  The following 
specifications must be met for this line to be considered as a valid 
primary description line.

The file name is valid and contains no spaces within it.

The file size is flush right in column #21.  No commas please.

The file date begins in column #24 and uses dashes to separate the date 
(e.g., 03-19-94).  All values less than 10 include leading zeroes as in 
"01" instead of " 1".

The file description begins in column 34 and must not extended beyond 
78.

The following shows some sample primary description lines:

PCB145AM.ZIP   168046  12-28-90  PCBoard v 14.5 ASCII Manual
PCBORDER.ZIP     2662  12-10-92  PCBoard v 14.x Ordering Information
PCBLINFO.ZIP     7205  01-18-89  PCBoard/LANtastic Thoughts/Ideas
PCBFILES.ZIP   259861  02-23-93* Complete List of All Files on Salt Air

As you can see, these listings all adhere to the proper format. If you 
do not adhere to the format as outlined previously, the entire line will 
be considered a text line and will be treated as such.

Secondary file listings:  Secondary lines allow you to improve the 
description of a file by providing a much longer description.  Rules for 
valid secondary lines are as follows:

* Must follow a valid primary or secondary file listing.
* Must begin with a space in the first column.
* Must include a vertical bar (a  character) somewhere on the line (the 
  default is in column 32 at the end of the date field).

PCBoard will, when displaying the file to the caller, remove the
vertical bar so as not to clutter up the display.

Colorization:  PCBoard performs automatic colorization of the DIR files 
as they are being displayed by recognizing text lines, filenames, sizes, 
dates, descriptions, and secondary lines according to the previous rules 
and according to the color scheme defined in PCBFiler's Choose DIR 
Colors menu option..

Any additional colorations desired (via @-codes) are permissable as long 
as they are placed in non-column-sensitive areas such as text or 
secondary lines.  You will not be able to place color codes anywhere to 
the left of the description field on a primary description line.

Adding New Files

At some point you will need to add files to your file directories.  You 
could be starting your BBS for the first time and adding new files, or 
you may have obtained a large number of files that you would like to add 
to a particular file directory. This section discusses the steps 
necessary to add files to a particular file directory.

To help illustrate this technique we are going to use a very simple 
setup as an example.  In our sample setup, all files are stored in the 
Main Board and there are only two directories defined in DIR.LST which 
looks like the following:


     DIR Text File Name & Path       Hard Disk Subdirectory       Sort
     -------------------------       ----------------------       ----
1)   C:\PCB\GEN\DIR1                 D:\DEMO\                       1
2)   C:\PCB\GEN\DIR2                 F:\UTILS\                      1


The first thing you need to do once you have decided on the directory 
that you want to add files to is to copy the files you want to add to 
the subdirectory specified in the Hard Disk Subdirectory field.

Once the files have been copied to the subdirectory, run PCBFiler so you 
can describe the files you just copied.

Use the Edit DIR Files menu option to load the directory you copied the 
files to into the directory editor.  Make sure you answer Y to the 
Include files found on DISK that are not listed in the DIR file.  If you 
do not, you will not be able to describe these files because they will 
not be listed in the Directory Editor.

Once the file is loaded into the editor, you can go to the end of the 
directory by pressing CTRL-PgDn twice.  You will  see the filenames you 
copied to the directory listed with either a DSK or a D next to the 
filename.  This is telling you that file exists in the subdirectory but 
there is no description for the file.  

Now simply move over to the description field and start entering 
descriptions for the files you copied to the directory.  When you are 
done entering all of the descriptions, press E to exit the Editor and 
save your changes.

Command Line Parameters

You can use command line parameters to modify what PCBFiler will do when 
it loads.  To use a command line parameter add the parameter after 
PCBFILER.EXE.  For example, you may type PCBFILER.EXE /LIST:3.  The 
/LIST:3 in this example is the command line parameter.

/CONF:[conf]

When PCBFiler loads, you will immediately be taken to the conference 
number you specify so you may begin editing file directories.  You are 
locked into this conference, and you cannot return to the Main Menu of 
PCBFiler.

For example, if you typed in PCBFILER /CONF:0 you may see the following:


               PCBFiler - A Utility for PCBoard Directories
                            Directory Selection


Available DIR numbers are 0 for PRIVATE and 1 through 1
Enter Number of Main Board DIR to Edit ? 1


Notice that you do not have to go through all of the menus to get where 
you need to get going.  In addition, this is very handy if you have 
conference SysOp or co-SysOps that you wantto lock into a particular 
conference so they do not edit files in conferences you do not want them 
to access.

/CONF:PCBOARD.SYS

This command line parameter is identical to the /CONF:[conf] parameter 
with one exception.  Instead of specifying a conference number to be 
locked into, PCBFiler will pull the current conference from the 
PCBOARD.SYS in the current directory.  If the PCBOARD.SYS does not have 
a conference number in it (because nobody is online), PCBFiler will 
return back to DOS.

/FILE:[location of PCBOARD.DAT]

PCBFiler needs to access the PCBOARD.DAT file so it can access 
information about your various file directories.  Normally, PCBFiler 
will look in the current directory for the PCBOARD.DAT file.  However, 
you can tell it where to find the file by using this command line 
parameter.

Simply replace the [location of PCBOARD.DAT] with the full path and 
filename where it can be found (e.g., C:\PCB\PCBOARD.DAT).


        Example

        PCBFILER /FILE:C:\PCB\PCBOARD.DAT

        The example above will load PCBFiler and tell it to use the 
        PCBOARD.DAT located in C:\PCB\.  If you did not use this 
        parameter, only the current directory will be searched.



/LIST:[conferences to include in the list]

Using this command line parameter is equivalent to selecting Create 
Files List from the PCBFiler Main Menu.  If you use /LIST as the command 
line parameter, the conferences that will be included in the list will 
be those that are listed in Defaults Page 2.  You may override these 
conferences by specifying a : after the /LIST followed by a list of 
conferences you want to include in the file lists.


        Examples

        PCBFILER /LIST:1

        The above example would create a file list using only the files 
        that are available from conference 1 on your system.

        PCBFILER /LIST:0-10,15

        This command line will create a file list of all files available 
        in conferences 0 through 10 and conference 15.



/PROCESS:conf:dir:[A]

If you have files that change dates or sizes on a regular basis, you may 
want to update the file descriptions to show the current file date and 
size.  This command line option enables you to update the file size and 
the file date.


NOTE:  In order to update the date, you must have answered Y to the 
Update FILE DATE with date found on disk file option in Defaults Page 1.

In order for this command line switch to work, you must specify the 
conference number and the directory number in the conference you want to 
update.

By adding :A to the end of the command line, PCBFiler will search all 
directories in your DLPATH.LST for the conference you specify to see if 
it can find the file on disk.  If the file cannot be found in the 
default location for the file directory or in the DLPATH.LST file, 
PCBFiler will not be able to update the file information.


        Examples

        PCBFILER /PROCESS:0:1

        This example would update the file information of file directory 
        #1 in conference #0 (Main Board)

        PCBFILER /PROCESS:1:1:A

        The example above would update the file directories in directory 
        #1 of conference #1.  Because the :A is specified, PCBFiler will 
        search all subdirectories listed in DLPATH.LST if it cannot find 
        the file in the default location for the file directory.



/SCAN

This is the equivalent of selecting Scan for Duplicate/Missing Files 
from the PCBFiler Main Menu.  This is most useful if you regularly scan 
for duplicate or missing files within an event. Remember, the report 
will be written to ANALYSIS.RPT in the current subdirectory.

/SCAN:[conferences to include in scan]

The only exception between this and the /SCAN parameter is that you may 
override the conferences you listed to include in dupe/missing scan in 
Defaults Page 2.  Simply enter the conferences to include in the scan 
after the colon.  For example, to include conferences 0-39 in the 
duplicate/missing scan, enter the following:


PCBFILER /SCAN:0-39



/SORT

Using this command line parameter is equivalent to selecting Sort all 
DIR Files from the Main Menu.  The only difference is you are not asked 
if you wish to sort only the upload directories of each conference.  All 
directory files will be sorted according to the methods you specified in 
DIR.LST.



/SORT:UPLOAD

All upload directories in all conferences will be re-sorted. The sort 
method used will be the one defined in the conference configuration.  
Remember, only the upload directories (private and public) will be 
sorted.  If you want to have all directories sorted, use /SORT instead.

Just unzip anywhere. IcyBoard works with relative and not absolute paths.


Create a bbs with:

bin/icbsetup create bbs

This creates all required files in "bbs" 

Or import an existing pcboard installation with:

bin/icbsetup import [PCBOARD.DAT] bbs

Where PCBOARD.DAT is the pull path to the pcboard data file. Note that the original installation won't be altered at all.
Howver it's not 100% so manual changes are likeley to be required but the output should be a good starting point. I can need test installations for improving the importer.

Then just start with:

bin/icy_board --file bbs

It's recommended to put bin/ in path and just start icy_board etc. inside the bbs directory - it'll be picked up all automatically.

Following tools are currently shipped

icbsetup - setting up with a tui client - in theory the .toml files can be edited with any text editor but it's easier with a tui
icbsysmgr - user/groups edutor.
mkicbtxt - create & alter PCBTEXT files (compatible with old PCBoard format)
mkicbmnu - create & change icy_board .mnu files 
pplc - ppl compiler 
ppl-language-server - a lsp implementation that can be used in editors that support it to get some syntax coloring, help and code completion for ppl 

The other tools are work in progress and will be split up into other commands.

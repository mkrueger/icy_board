# State of PCBoard features

That is the current state of PCBoard features supported.
Not the state of ICY BOARD features - that would make it too long and it's important to know what works
from PCBoard.

If something is missing just let me know.

# Unsupported Features

Some things will never work/out of scope.

| Feature | Reason | 
| :--- | :--- |
| DOS | Purely outdated - 90% of the libs I use won't run and icy board is too memory hungry for the DOS world. | 
| Fossil drivers | See above | 
| PPE DOS/Assembler functions | See above | 
| Printer support | Are you serious? |
